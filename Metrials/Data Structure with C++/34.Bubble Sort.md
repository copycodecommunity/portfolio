Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Here's a C++ implementation along with explanations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void bubbleSort(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();

    // Perform (n-1) passes
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        // Last i elements are already sorted, no need to check them
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; ++j) {
            // Compare adjacent elements and swap if they are in the wrong order
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                std::swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}

void printArray(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    for (int num : arr) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> myArray = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
    
    std::cout << "Original Array: ";
    printArray(myArray);

    // Sort the array using Bubble Sort
    bubbleSort(myArray);

    std::cout << "Sorted Array: ";
    printArray(myArray);

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`void bubbleSort(std::vector<int>& arr)`:**
   - This function performs the Bubble Sort algorithm on a vector of integers. It takes a reference to the vector to modify it in-place.

2. **`for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i)`:**
   - The outer loop represents the number of passes through the array. After each pass, the largest unsorted element settles at the end.

3. **`for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; ++j)`:**
   - The inner loop iterates through the unsorted portion of the array. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

4. **`std::swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1])`:**
   - The `swap` function from the `<algorithm>` header is used to interchange the elements.

5. **`void printArray(const std::vector<int>& arr)`:**
   - This function prints the elements of the array.

6. **`main` function:**
   - An example array is declared and printed before and after sorting.

**Visualization:**
Bubble Sort can be visualized as follows:

- Pass 1:
  ```
  [64, 25, 12, 22, 11] --> [25, 12, 22, 11, 64]
  [25, 12, 22, 11, 64] --> [12, 22, 11, 25, 64]
  [12, 22, 11, 25, 64] --> [12, 11, 22, 25, 64]
  [12, 11, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  ```

- Pass 2:
  ```
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  ```

- Pass 3:
  ```
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  ```

- Pass 4:
  ```
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] --> [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
  ```

- The array is now sorted.
