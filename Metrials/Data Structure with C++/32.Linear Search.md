Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that searches for an element in a list sequentially. In C++, you can implement the Linear Search algorithm as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Linear Search Function
int linearSearch(const std::vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i; // Return the index if the target is found
        }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if the target is not found
}

int main() {
    // Sample array for demonstration
    std::vector<int> myArray = {2, 5, 1, 9, 7, 4, 3, 8, 6};

    // Element to search
    int target = 7;

    // Perform Linear Search
    int result = linearSearch(myArray, target);

    // Display the result
    if (result != -1) {
        std::cout << "Element found at index: " << result << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Element not found in the array." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`linearSearch` Function:**
   - The `linearSearch` function takes a vector `arr` and an integer `target` as parameters.
   - It iterates through the elements of the vector using a `for` loop.
   - If the target element is found, it returns the index of the element; otherwise, it returns -1.

2. **`main` Function:**
   - A sample array (`myArray`) is used for demonstration purposes.
   - The target element (`target`) is set to 7.
   - The `linearSearch` function is called, and the result is stored in the `result` variable.

3. **Displaying Result:**
   - If the result is not -1, it means the element is found, and the index is displayed.
   - If the result is -1, it means the element is not found in the array.

**Visualization:**

A linear search can be visualized as follows:

```
Array: [2, 5, 1, 9, 7, 4, 3, 8, 6]
Target: 7

Iteration 1:  Element 2 (Not Matched)
Iteration 2:  Element 5 (Not Matched)
Iteration 3:  Element 1 (Not Matched)
Iteration 4:  Element 9 (Not Matched)
Iteration 5:  Element 7 (Matched at Index 4)

Element found at index: 4
```

In this visualization, the linear search sequentially checks each element in the array until it finds the target element (7 in this case). The index where the target element is found is then displayed.
