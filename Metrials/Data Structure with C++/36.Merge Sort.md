The Merge Sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half separately, and then merging the sorted halves. Here's a simple implementation in C++ along with an explanation. Unfortunately, I can't provide visual diagrams, but I'll describe the process.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void merge(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
    int n1 = mid - left + 1;
    int n2 = right - mid;

    // Create temporary arrays
    std::vector<int> L(n1), R(n2);

    // Copy data to temporary arrays L[] and R[]
    for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
        L[i] = arr[left + i];
    for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++)
        R[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];

    // Merge the two halves back into arr[]
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left;
    while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
        if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
            arr[k] = L[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            arr[k] = R[j];
            j++;
        }
        k++;
    }

    // Copy the remaining elements of L[], if there are any
    while (i < n1) {
        arr[k] = L[i];
        i++;
        k++;
    }

    // Copy the remaining elements of R[], if there are any
    while (j < n2) {
        arr[k] = R[j];
        j++;
        k++;
    }
}

void mergeSort(std::vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {
    if (left < right) {
        // Same as (left + right) / 2, but avoids overflow
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        // Sort first and second halves
        mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
        mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);

        // Merge the sorted halves
        merge(arr, left, mid, right);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};

    std::cout << "Original array: ";
    for (int num : arr) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    int arrSize = arr.size();
    mergeSort(arr, 0, arrSize - 1);

    std::cout << "Sorted array: ";
    for (int num : arr) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mergeSort` Function:**
   - The `mergeSort` function recursively divides the array into halves until each subarray has one element.

2. **`merge` Function:**
   - The `merge` function is responsible for merging two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

3. **Divide and Conquer:**
   - The array is divided into two halves repeatedly until each subarray has one element.
   - The merging process combines the sorted subarrays to create larger sorted subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

4. **Visualization:**
   - The algorithm can be visualized as a tree, where each node represents a recursive call to `mergeSort`.
   - Leaf nodes represent one-element arrays, and the merging process occurs as you move up the tree.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets.
   - It requires additional space for the temporary arrays used in the merging process.

Remember that this is a basic textual explanation, and visualization tools like debuggers or online sorting visualizers can help you see the algorithm in action.
