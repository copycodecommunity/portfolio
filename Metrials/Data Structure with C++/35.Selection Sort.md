Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it at the beginning (or end). Here's the implementation of Selection Sort in C++ with an explanation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        // Assume the current index is the minimum
        int minIndex = i;

        // Find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = j;
            }
        }

        // Swap the found minimum element with the element at index i
        if (minIndex != i) {
            std::swap(arr[i], arr[minIndex]);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {64, 25, 12, 22, 11};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    std::cout << "Original Array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Apply Selection Sort
    selectionSort(arr, n);

    std::cout << "Sorted Array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function `selectionSort`:**
   - The function takes an array and its size as parameters.
   - It iterates through the array, assuming the current index as the minimum.
   - Finds the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.
   - Swaps the found minimum element with the element at the current index.

2. **`main` Function:**
   - Initializes an array with unsorted values.
   - Displays the original array.
   - Calls `selectionSort` to sort the array.
   - Displays the sorted array.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements.

4. **In-Place Sorting:**
   - Selection Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm as it doesn't use additional memory for sorting.

Visualization of the Selection Sort algorithm with a diagram is challenging in a text-based format. You may use visual tools like online platforms or IDEs that provide debugging features with step-by-step visualization to observe the algorithm in action.
