Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, visiting all neighbors of a vertex before moving on to the next level. Here's an implementation of BFS in C++ with an explanation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

class Graph {
public:
    int vertices;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> adjacencyList;

    // Constructor to initialize the graph with a given number of vertices
    Graph(int v) : vertices(v), adjacencyList(v) {}

    // Function to add an edge between two vertices
    void addEdge(int src, int dest) {
        adjacencyList[src].push_back(dest);
        adjacencyList[dest].push_back(src); // For undirected graph
    }

    // BFS traversal starting from a given source vertex
    void bfs(int startVertex) {
        // Mark all vertices as not visited
        std::vector<bool> visited(vertices, false);

        // Create a queue for BFS
        std::queue<int> bfsQueue;

        // Mark the current node as visited and enqueue it
        visited[startVertex] = true;
        bfsQueue.push(startVertex);

        std::cout << "BFS Traversal starting from vertex " << startVertex << ": ";

        while (!bfsQueue.empty()) {
            // Dequeue a vertex from the queue and print it
            int currentVertex = bfsQueue.front();
            std::cout << currentVertex << " ";
            bfsQueue.pop();

            // Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex
            for (int neighbor : adjacencyList[currentVertex]) {
                // If the adjacent vertex hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    bfsQueue.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a graph with 6 vertices
    Graph g(6);

    // Add edges to the graph
    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 3);
    g.addEdge(1, 4);
    g.addEdge(2, 4);
    g.addEdge(3, 5);
    g.addEdge(4, 5);

    // Perform BFS starting from vertex 0
    g.bfs(0);

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list. `adjacencyList` is a vector of vectors, where each vector represents the neighbors of a vertex.

2. **`Graph` Class:**
   - A `Graph` class is defined with member functions for adding edges and performing BFS traversal.

3. **`addEdge` Function:**
   - The `addEdge` function adds an edge between two vertices. For an undirected graph, edges are added in both directions.

4. **BFS Function:**
   - The `bfs` function takes a starting vertex as an argument and performs BFS traversal.
   - It uses a boolean array `visited` to keep track of visited vertices.
   - A queue is used to keep track of vertices to be visited.

5. **BFS Traversal:**
   - The BFS traversal starts from the specified vertex, marking it as visited and enqueueing it.
   - While the queue is not empty, a vertex is dequeued, and its neighbors are enqueued if they haven't been visited.
   - The process continues until all reachable vertices are visited.

6. **Main Function:**
   - In the `main` function, a graph is created, edges are added, and BFS is performed starting from vertex 0.

BFS is a fundamental algorithm used for traversing graphs and finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
