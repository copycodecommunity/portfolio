Certainly! The binary search algorithm is an efficient way to search for an element in a sorted array. Below is a C++ implementation of binary search with an explanation. I'll also provide a textual representation of how the algorithm works.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Binary search function
int binarySearch(const std::vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.size() - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        // Check if target is present at the middle
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        }

        // If target is greater, ignore the left half
        else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }

        // If target is smaller, ignore the right half
        else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    // If target is not present in the array
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> sortedArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    int target = 7;

    int result = binarySearch(sortedArray, target);

    if (result != -1) {
        std::cout << "Element " << target << " found at index " << result << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Element " << target << " not found in the array" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function `binarySearch`:**
   - The function takes a sorted array (`arr`) and a target value (`target`) as parameters.
   - It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the search range.
   - Inside the `while` loop, it calculates the middle index (`mid`) and compares the value at the middle with the target.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm:**
   - If the middle element is equal to the target, the search is successful, and the index is returned.
   - If the middle element is less than the target, the left half of the array is ignored by updating the `left` pointer.
   - If the middle element is greater than the target, the right half of the array is ignored by updating the `right` pointer.

3. **Result Handling:**
   - If the target is not found in the array, the function returns -1.

**Visualization:**

Consider the array `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}` and the target value `7`. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. **Initial state:** `left = 0`, `right = 9`, `mid = 4` (`arr[mid] = 5`).
   - Since `5` is less than `7`, we ignore the left half and update `left = mid + 1`.

2. **Second iteration:** `left = 5`, `right = 9`, `mid = 7` (`arr[mid] = 8`).
   - `8` is greater than `7`, so we ignore the right half and update `right = mid - 1`.

3. **Third iteration:** `left = 5`, `right = 6`, `mid = 5` (`arr[mid] = 6`).
   - The target `7` is found at index `5`, so the function returns `5`.

This is a simplified visualization, and in each iteration, the search space is effectively halved, making binary search more efficient than linear search.
