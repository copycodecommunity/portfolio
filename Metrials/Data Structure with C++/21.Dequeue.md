A deque (double-ended queue) is a data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and the back. In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides the `std::deque` container, which can be used to implement a deque efficiently. Here's an explanation and example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>

int main() {
    // Declare a deque
    std::deque<int> myDeque;

    // Push elements to the back of the deque
    myDeque.push_back(1);
    myDeque.push_back(2);
    myDeque.push_back(3);

    // Push elements to the front of the deque
    myDeque.push_front(0);
    myDeque.push_front(-1);

    // Display the deque elements
    std::cout << "Deque elements: ";
    for (int num : myDeque) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Pop element from the front
    myDeque.pop_front();

    // Pop element from the back
    myDeque.pop_back();

    // Display the modified deque
    std::cout << "Modified deque: ";
    for (int num : myDeque) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`#include <deque>`:**
   - This line includes the `<deque>` header, which contains the `std::deque` template class in the C++ Standard Template Library.

2. **Declaration and Initialization:**
   - `std::deque<int> myDeque;`: Declares a deque named `myDeque` that can store integers.

3. **Pushing Elements:**
   - `push_back(value)`: Adds an element to the back of the deque.
   - `push_front(value)`: Adds an element to the front of the deque.

4. **Displaying Elements:**
   - The `for` loop is used to iterate through the deque and display its elements.

5. **Popping Elements:**
   - `pop_front()`: Removes the element from the front of the deque.
   - `pop_back()`: Removes the element from the back of the deque.

6. **Note:**
   - Deques provide constant time insertion and removal of elements at both ends, unlike vectors where inserting or removing elements from the front takes linear time.

Using the `std::deque` container simplifies the implementation of a double-ended queue, and it provides efficient operations for adding or removing elements at both ends.
