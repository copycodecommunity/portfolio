A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. In C++, you can implement a binary tree using a class-based approach. Here's an example of a binary tree with explanations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    // Constructor to initialize the node
    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform an in-order traversal of the binary tree
void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    // Recursively traverse the left subtree
    inOrderTraversal(root->left);

    // Process the current node
    std::cout << root->data << " ";

    // Recursively traverse the right subtree
    inOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    // Perform an in-order traversal and display the elements
    std::cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    inOrderTraversal(root);

    // Clean up: deallocate memory (optional in some cases, depends on usage)
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`struct TreeNode`:**
   - Defines the structure of a binary tree node. Each node contains an integer data value, a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child.
   - The constructor initializes the node with a given value and sets both left and right pointers to `nullptr`.

2. **`inOrderTraversal` Function:**
   - Performs an in-order traversal of the binary tree (left subtree, current node, right subtree).
   - Uses recursion to traverse the left and right subtrees.
   - Prints the data of each node during the traversal.

3. **`main` Function:**
   - Creates a binary tree with five nodes.
   - Calls the `inOrderTraversal` function to display the elements in the order they are visited during an in-order traversal.

4. **Memory Deallocation (Clean Up):**
   - Deallocates memory for each node after its usage. This step is optional and depends on the overall usage and scope of the binary tree.

This example provides a basic implementation of a binary tree in C++. In practice, you might use more advanced techniques, classes, or templates for a more comprehensive binary tree implementation, depending on your specific requirements.
