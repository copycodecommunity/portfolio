Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal algorithm used to explore all the vertices of a graph or tree in depth before moving on to the next branch. Here's an example of implementing DFS in C++ for a graph using an adjacency list representation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

class Graph {
private:
    int vertices;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> adjacencyList;

public:
    Graph(int v) : vertices(v), adjacencyList(v) {}

    void addEdge(int from, int to) {
        adjacencyList[from].push_back(to);
    }

    void dfs(int startVertex) {
        std::vector<bool> visited(vertices, false);
        std::stack<int> stack;

        // Start DFS from the given vertex
        stack.push(startVertex);
        visited[startVertex] = true;

        while (!stack.empty()) {
            int currentVertex = stack.top();
            stack.pop();

            // Process the current vertex
            std::cout << currentVertex << " ";

            // Explore adjacent vertices
            for (int neighbor : adjacencyList[currentVertex]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    stack.push(neighbor);
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a graph
    Graph graph(5);
    graph.addEdge(0, 1);
    graph.addEdge(0, 2);
    graph.addEdge(1, 3);
    graph.addEdge(1, 4);

    // Perform DFS starting from vertex 0
    std::cout << "DFS starting from vertex 0: ";
    graph.dfs(0);

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list. The `Graph` class has a member `adjacencyList` which is a vector of vectors, where each index represents a vertex, and the corresponding vector contains the neighbors of that vertex.

2. **Adding Edges:**
   - The `addEdge` method is used to add edges to the graph.

3. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` method performs Depth-First Search. It uses a stack to keep track of the vertices to visit.
   - The `visited` vector is used to mark vertices that have been visited.

4. **DFS Implementation:**
   - The algorithm starts from a given vertex, pushes it onto the stack, and marks it as visited.
   - It then enters a loop where it processes the current vertex, pops it from the stack, and explores its neighbors.
   - If a neighbor has not been visited, it is pushed onto the stack and marked as visited.

5. **Main Function:**
   - In the `main` function, a sample graph is created, and DFS is performed starting from vertex 0.

This example demonstrates a simple implementation of DFS for a graph. Depending on the specific requirements, the graph representation and DFS implementation might be adjusted.
