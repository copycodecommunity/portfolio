In C++, structures are user-defined data types that allow you to group together variables of different data types under a single name. Here's an overview of structures in C++ with explanations:

### Declaration of Structure:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Define a structure
struct Student {
    // Data members or fields
    int rollNumber;
    string name;
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    // Declare a structure variable
    Student student1;

    // Access and assign values to structure members
    student1.rollNumber = 101;
    student1.name = "John";
    student1.marks = 85.5;

    // Displaying structure data
    cout << "Roll Number: " << student1.rollNumber << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << student1.name << endl;
    cout << "Marks: " << student1.marks << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Declaration of Structure:**
   - The `struct` keyword is used to define a structure. In this example, the `Student` structure contains three data members: `rollNumber`, `name`, and `marks`.

2. **Declaration of Structure Variable:**
   - After defining the structure, you can declare variables of that type. In the example, `Student student1;` declares a variable `student1` of type `Student`.

3. **Accessing and Assigning Values:**
   - You can access and assign values to the individual members of the structure using the dot (`.`) operator. For example, `student1.rollNumber = 101;` assigns the value 101 to the `rollNumber` member of `student1`.

4. **Displaying Structure Data:**
   - The values stored in the structure can be displayed using the `cout` statement. This allows you to organize and represent related information in a structured manner.

### Array of Structures:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Student {
    int rollNumber;
    string name;
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    const int SIZE = 3;
    Student students[SIZE];

    // Input data for each student
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; ++i) {
        cout << "Enter details for student " << i + 1 << ":\n";
        cout << "Roll Number: ";
        cin >> students[i].rollNumber;
        cout << "Name: ";
        cin >> students[i].name;
        cout << "Marks: ";
        cin >> students[i].marks;
    }

    // Displaying data for each student
    cout << "\nDetails of students:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; ++i) {
        cout << "Student " << i + 1 << ":\n";
        cout << "Roll Number: " << students[i].rollNumber << endl;
        cout << "Name: " << students[i].name << endl;
        cout << "Marks: " << students[i].marks << endl << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Array of Structures:**
   - You can create an array of structures to store multiple records of the same type. In this example, `Student students[SIZE];` declares an array of `Student` structures.

2. **Input Data for Each Student:**
   - Using a loop, you can input data for each student in the array. This allows you to efficiently manage and store information for multiple entities.

3. **Displaying Data for Each Student:**
   - Another loop is used to display the details of each student stored in the array. This illustrates how structures can be employed to organize data for a group of related entities.

Structures in C++ provide a way to group related variables together, making the code more organized and readable. They are fundamental in designing and implementing complex data structures.
