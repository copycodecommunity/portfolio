A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting these nodes. In C++, you can represent a graph using various data structures. One common way is to use an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix. Below is an example of representing a graph using an adjacency list and implementing basic operations. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>

class Graph {
private:
    int vertices;
    std::vector<std::list<int>> adjacencyList;

public:
    Graph(int V) : vertices(V), adjacencyList(V) {}

    // Add an edge to the graph
    void addEdge(int src, int dest) {
        adjacencyList[src].push_back(dest);
        adjacencyList[dest].push_back(src);  // For an undirected graph
    }

    // Display the adjacency list representation of the graph
    void display() {
        std::cout << "Adjacency List representation:\n";
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; ++i) {
            std::cout << i << " -> ";
            for (const auto& neighbor : adjacencyList[i]) {
                std::cout << neighbor << " ";
            }
            std::cout << "\n";
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a graph with 5 vertices
    Graph myGraph(5);

    // Add edges to the graph
    myGraph.addEdge(0, 1);
    myGraph.addEdge(0, 2);
    myGraph.addEdge(1, 3);
    myGraph.addEdge(2, 4);

    // Display the adjacency list
    myGraph.display();

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`class Graph` Declaration:**
   - `Graph` class is declared to represent the graph.

2. **Class Members:**
   - `vertices`: Represents the number of vertices in the graph.
   - `adjacencyList`: A vector of lists where each element is a list representing the neighbors of a vertex.

3. **Constructor:**
   - The constructor initializes the number of vertices and the adjacency list.

4. **`addEdge` Function:**
   - Adds an edge between two vertices by updating the adjacency lists of both vertices.

5. **`display` Function:**
   - Displays the adjacency list representation of the graph.

6. **`main` Function:**
   - Creates a graph object and adds edges to it.
   - Calls the `display` function to show the adjacency list.

This is a simple representation of an undirected graph using an adjacency list. In more complex scenarios, you might use other representations or add additional features depending on the requirements of your graph-based algorithm or application.
