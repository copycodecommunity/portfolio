In MySQL, the `ANY` and `ALL` operators are used in conjunction with comparison operators to compare a value to a set of values returned by a subquery. They help you determine if a condition is true for any or all values in a set.

### `ANY` Operator

The `ANY` operator allows you to compare a value to any value in a set returned by a subquery. If the comparison is true for at least one of the values, the condition is satisfied.

#### Example of `ANY`

Let's say you have a table called `products`:

**Table: products**

| product_id | product_name | price |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1          | Apples       | 1.00  |
| 2          | Oranges      | 0.50  |
| 3          | Bananas      | 0.75  |
| 4          | Grapes       | 2.00  |

### Goal

You want to find products that are cheaper than any of the products that cost more than $1.00.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT product_name
FROM products
WHERE price < ANY (
    SELECT price
    FROM products
    WHERE price > 1.00
);
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT product_name**: This selects the `product_name` column from the `products` table.
- **WHERE price < ANY**: This checks if the price of the product is less than any price returned by the subquery.
- **Subquery**: 
  - **SELECT price FROM products WHERE price > 1.00**: This subquery returns the prices of products that cost more than $1.00.

### Result

After running the query, you would get a result like this:

| product_name |
|--------------|
| Oranges      |
| Bananas      |

### `ALL` Operator

The `ALL` operator allows you to compare a value to all values in a set returned by a subquery. The condition is satisfied only if the comparison is true for every value in the set.

#### Example of `ALL`

Using the same `products` table, let's say you want to find products that are more expensive than all products that cost less than $1.00.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT product_name
FROM products
WHERE price > ALL (
    SELECT price
    FROM products
    WHERE price < 1.00
);
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT product_name**: This selects the `product_name` column from the `products` table.
- **WHERE price > ALL**: This checks if the price of the product is greater than all prices returned by the subquery.
- **Subquery**: 
  - **SELECT price FROM products WHERE price < 1.00**: This subquery returns the prices of products that cost less than $1.00.

### Result

After running the query, you would get a result like this:

| product_name |
|--------------|
| Grapes       |

### Summary

- **`ANY`**: Returns true if the condition is true for at least one value in the set.
- **`ALL`**: Returns true only if the condition is true for every value in the set.
- Both operators are used with comparison operators and subqueries to filter results based on a set of values.
