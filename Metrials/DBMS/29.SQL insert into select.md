The `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` statement in MySQL is used to insert data into a table by selecting data from another table. This is useful when you want to copy data from one table to another or when you want to insert data based on a query.

### How `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` Works

1. **Target Table**: You specify the table where you want to insert the data.
2. **Columns**: You specify the columns in the target table that will receive the data.
3. **Select Data**: You write a `SELECT` statement to choose the data you want to insert.
4. **Conditions**: You can use conditions to filter the data being selected.

### Syntax

The basic syntax for `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` is:

```sql
INSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, ...)
SELECT value1, value2, ...
FROM source_table
WHERE condition;
```

### Example

Let's say you have two tables: `employees` and `archived_employees`.

**Table: employees**

| employee_id | name      | department | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1           | Alice     | HR         | 60000  |
| 2           | Bob       | IT         | 70000  |
| 3           | Charlie   | IT         | 80000  |
| 4           | David     | Sales      | 50000  |

**Table: archived_employees**

| employee_id | name      | department | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 5           | Eve       | Marketing  | 55000  |

### Goal

Suppose you want to archive employees from the IT department into the `archived_employees` table.

### SQL Query

```sql
INSERT INTO archived_employees (employee_id, name, department, salary)
SELECT employee_id, name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

### Explanation

- **INSERT INTO archived_employees (employee_id, name, department, salary)**: This specifies the target table (`archived_employees`) and the columns where the data will be inserted.
- **SELECT employee_id, name, department, salary**: This selects the data from the `employees` table.
- **FROM employees**: This specifies the source table.
- **WHERE department = 'IT'**: This filters the results to include only employees from the IT department.

### Result

After running the query, the `archived_employees` table would look like this:

**Table: archived_employees**

| employee_id | name      | department | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 5           | Eve       | Marketing  | 55000  |
| 2           | Bob       | IT         | 70000  |
| 3           | Charlie   | IT         | 80000  |

### Summary

- The `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` statement allows you to insert data into a table by selecting it from another table.
- You can specify which columns to insert into and filter the data using a `WHERE` clause.
- This is useful for data migration, archiving, and creating backups.
