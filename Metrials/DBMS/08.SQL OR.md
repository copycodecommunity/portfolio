In MySQL, the `OR` operator is used in the `WHERE` clause to combine multiple conditions. It allows you to filter records that meet at least one of the specified conditions. When you use `OR`, a record will be included in the result set if any of the conditions are true.

### Simple Explanation:
- **`OR`**: This operator is used to combine two or more conditions in a query.
- At least one of the conditions connected by `OR` must be true for a record to be included in the results.

### Example:
Let's say you have a table called `products` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, and `category`.

| id | name       | category   |
|----|------------|------------|
| 1  | Laptop     | Electronics|
| 2  | Banana     | Fruits     |
| 3  | TV         | Electronics|
| 4  | Apple      | Fruits     |
| 5  | Blender    | Appliances |

#### Using `OR` to Filter Records:
If you want to find products that are either in the "Fruits" category or the "Electronics" category, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Fruits' OR category = 'Electronics';
```

### Result:
This query will return the following records:

| id | name       | category   |
|----|------------|------------|
| 1  | Laptop     | Electronics|
| 2  | Banana     | Fruits     |
| 3  | TV         | Electronics|
| 4  | Apple      | Fruits     |

### Explanation:
- The query checks each record in the `products` table.
- It includes records where either condition (`category = 'Fruits'` or `category = 'Electronics'`) is true.
- In this case, all products that belong to either of these categories are included in the result.

### Combining `AND` and `OR`:
You can also combine `AND` and `OR` in a single query. For example, if you want to find products that are either in the "Fruits" category or are "Laptops," you can write:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Fruits' OR name = 'Laptop';
```

### Result:
This query will return:

| id | name       | category   |
|----|------------|------------|
| 1  | Laptop     | Electronics|
| 2  | Banana     | Fruits     |
| 4  | Apple      | Fruits     |

### Summary:
- The `OR` operator is useful for filtering results based on multiple criteria where at least one condition must be true.
- This allows for more flexible queries when you want to include records that meet any of several conditions.
