In MySQL, the `INSERT INTO` statement is used to add new records (rows) to a table. This command allows you to specify the table where you want to insert data and the values for each column.

### Simple Explanation:
- **`INSERT INTO`**: This command is used to insert new data into a table.
- You can specify the columns you want to fill, or you can insert values for all columns in the order they are defined in the table.

### Syntax:
1. **Inserting into specific columns**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
   VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
   ```

2. **Inserting into all columns**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO table_name
   VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
   ```

### Example:
Let's say you have a table called `students` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, and `age`.

| id | name   | age |
|----|--------|-----|
| 1  | Alice  | 20  |
| 2  | Bob    | 22  |

#### Inserting into Specific Columns:
If you want to add a new student named Charlie who is 21 years old, you can use the following query:

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age)
VALUES ('Charlie', 21);
```

### Result:
After executing the above query, the `students` table will look like this:

| id | name   | age |
|----|--------|-----|
| 1  | Alice  | 20  |
| 2  | Bob    | 22  |
| 3  | Charlie| 21  |

#### Inserting into All Columns:
If you want to insert a new student and provide values for all columns, you can do it like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO students
VALUES (4, 'David', 23);
```

### Result:
After executing this query, the `students` table will now look like this:

| id | name   | age |
|----|--------|-----|
| 1  | Alice  | 20  |
| 2  | Bob    | 22  |
| 3  | Charlie| 21  |
| 4  | David  | 23  |

### Important Notes:
- The `id` column is usually an auto-incrementing primary key, which means you don't need to specify it when inserting new records. If it's set to auto-increment, you can simply omit it from the `INSERT` statement.
- If you try to insert a record with a duplicate primary key (like `id`), you will get an error unless you handle it with specific options (like `INSERT IGNORE` or `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`).

### Summary:
- The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to add new records to a table in MySQL.
- You can specify which columns to fill or insert values for all columns.
- This command is essential for adding data to your database tables.
