The `CASE` statement in MySQL is a way to perform conditional logic in your SQL queries. It allows you to evaluate a set of conditions and return a specific value based on which condition is true. This is similar to an "if-then-else" statement in programming.

### How `CASE` Works

1. **Evaluate Conditions**: You define a series of conditions to evaluate.
2. **Return Values**: For each condition, you specify a value to return if that condition is true.
3. **Default Value**: You can also specify a default value to return if none of the conditions are met.

### Syntax

There are two types of `CASE` statements: **simple** and **searched**.

#### Simple CASE Syntax

```sql
CASE expression
    WHEN value1 THEN result1
    WHEN value2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE default_result
END
```

#### Searched CASE Syntax

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE default_result
END
```

### Example

Let's say you have a table called `employees`:

**Table: employees**

| employee_id | name      | department | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1           | Alice     | HR         | 60000  |
| 2           | Bob       | IT         | 70000  |
| 3           | Charlie   | IT         | 80000  |
| 4           | David     | Sales      | 50000  |

### Goal

Suppose you want to categorize employees based on their salary into "Low", "Medium", and "High".

### SQL Query Using `CASE`

```sql
SELECT name, salary,
    CASE
        WHEN salary < 60000 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 60000 AND 80000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High'
    END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT name, salary**: This selects the `name` and `salary` columns from the `employees` table.
- **CASE**: This starts the `CASE` statement.
- **WHEN salary < 60000 THEN 'Low'**: If the salary is less than 60000, it returns 'Low'.
- **WHEN salary BETWEEN 60000 AND 80000 THEN 'Medium'**: If the salary is between 60000 and 80000, it returns 'Medium'.
- **ELSE 'High'**: If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'High'.
- **AS salary_category**: This gives a name to the resulting column.

### Result

After running the query, you would get a result like this:

| name    | salary | salary_category |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Alice   | 60000  | Medium          |
| Bob     | 70000  | Medium          |
| Charlie | 80000  | High            |
| David   | 50000  | Low             |

### Summary

- The `CASE` statement allows you to perform conditional logic in SQL queries.
- You can categorize or transform data based on specific conditions.
- It can be used in `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
