In MySQL, the concept of "selecting the top" records is typically achieved using the `LIMIT` clause. This allows you to specify the maximum number of records to return from a query. While SQL Server uses `TOP`, MySQL uses `LIMIT` to achieve similar functionality.

### Simple Explanation:
- **`SELECT`**: This command is used to retrieve data from a database.
- **`LIMIT`**: This clause is used to specify the maximum number of records to return.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_records;
```

### Example:
Let's say you have a table called `products` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, and `price`.

| id | name       | price |
|----|------------|-------|
| 1  | Laptop     | 1000  |
| 2  | Smartphone | 800   |
| 3  | Tablet     | 600   |
| 4  | Monitor    | 300   |
| 5  | Keyboard   | 50    |

#### Selecting the Top N Records:
If you want to select the top 3 most expensive products, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause in combination with `LIMIT`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Result:
This query will return the following records:

| id | name       | price |
|----|------------|-------|
| 1  | Laptop     | 1000  |
| 2  | Smartphone | 800   |
| 3  | Tablet     | 600   |

### Explanation:
- The `ORDER BY price DESC` part sorts the products by price in descending order (from highest to lowest).
- The `LIMIT 3` part restricts the result to the top 3 records based on the sorted order.

### Selecting with OFFSET:
You can also use `LIMIT` with an `OFFSET` to skip a certain number of records. For example, if you want to skip the top 2 most expensive products and get the next 2, you can do:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
```

### Result:
This query will return:

| id | name     | price |
|----|----------|-------|
| 3  | Tablet   | 600   |
| 4  | Monitor  | 300   |

### Summary:
- In MySQL, you use the `LIMIT` clause to select the top N records from a query.
- You can combine `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` to control which records are returned based on sorting criteria.
- You can also use `LIMIT` with `OFFSET` to skip a specified number of records before returning the results.
