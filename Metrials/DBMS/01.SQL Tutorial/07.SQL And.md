In MySQL, the `AND` operator is used in the `WHERE` clause to combine multiple conditions. It allows you to filter records that meet all specified conditions. When you use `AND`, a record will only be included in the result set if all the conditions are true.

### Simple Explanation:
- **`AND`**: This operator is used to combine two or more conditions in a query.
- All conditions connected by `AND` must be true for a record to be included in the results.

### Example:
Let's say you have a table called `students` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, `age`, and `grade`.

| id | name   | age | grade |
|----|--------|-----|-------|
| 1  | Alice  | 20  | A     |
| 2  | Bob    | 22  | B     |
| 3  | Charlie| 20  | A     |
| 4  | David  | 23  | C     |
| 5  | Eva    | 21  | B     |

#### Using `AND` to Filter Records:
If you want to find students who are 20 years old and have a grade of 'A', you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age = 20 AND grade = 'A';
```

### Result:
This query will return the following records:

| id | name   | age | grade |
|----|--------|-----|-------|
| 1  | Alice  | 20  | A     |
| 3  | Charlie| 20  | A     |

### Explanation:
- The query checks each record in the `students` table.
- It only includes records where both conditions (`age = 20` and `grade = 'A'`) are true.
- In this case, both Alice and Charlie meet these criteria.

### Summary:
- The `AND` operator is useful for filtering results based on multiple criteria.
- All conditions connected by `AND` must be true for a record to be included in the result set.
- This allows for more precise queries when you need to meet several conditions simultaneously.
