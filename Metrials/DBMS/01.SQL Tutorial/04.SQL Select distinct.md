The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement in MySQL is used to retrieve unique values from a specific column or a combination of columns in a table. This means that it filters out duplicate entries, allowing you to see only the different values present in the specified column(s).

### Basic Syntax of SELECT DISTINCT
The basic syntax for using `SELECT DISTINCT` is as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
```

- **SELECT DISTINCT**: This tells MySQL that you want to select unique values.
- **column1, column2, ...**: These are the names of the columns from which you want to retrieve unique values.
- **FROM table_name**: This specifies the table from which you want to retrieve the data.

### Example Scenario
Letâ€™s say you have a table called `customers` with the following data:

| id | name       | email              |
|----|------------|--------------------|
| 1  | John Doe  | john@example.com    |
| 2  | Jane Smith| jane@example.com    |
| 3  | John Doe  | john@example.com    |
| 4  | Alice Lee | alice@example.com   |
| 5  | Bob Brown  | bob@example.com     |

### Example 1: Using SELECT DISTINCT on One Column
If you want to retrieve a list of unique names from the `customers` table, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM customers;
```

**Result:**

| name       |
|------------|
| John Doe  |
| Jane Smith |
| Alice Lee  |
| Bob Brown  |

In this example, the duplicate entry for "John Doe" is removed, and you get a list of unique names.

### Example 2: Using SELECT DISTINCT on Multiple Columns
You can also use `SELECT DISTINCT` to get unique combinations of values from multiple columns. For instance, if you want to find unique combinations of names and emails, you can use:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, email FROM customers;
```

**Result:**

| name       | email              |
|------------|--------------------|
| John Doe  | john@example.com    |
| Jane Smith| jane@example.com    |
| Alice Lee | alice@example.com   |
| Bob Brown  | bob@example.com     |

In this case, even though "John Doe" appears twice in the table, the combination of name and email is unique, so it appears only once in the result.

### Example 3: Using SELECT DISTINCT with WHERE Clause
You can also combine `SELECT DISTINCT` with a `WHERE` clause to filter the results. For example, if you want to find unique names of customers whose email contains "example.com":

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM customers WHERE email LIKE '%example.com';
```

**Result:**

| name       |
|------------|
| John Doe  |
| Jane Smith |
| Alice Lee  |
| Bob Brown  |

### Conclusion
The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is a powerful tool in MySQL for retrieving unique values from your database. It helps you eliminate duplicates and focus on the distinct entries you need. By using it with one or more columns, you can customize your queries to get the exact data you want.
