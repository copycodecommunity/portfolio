In MySQL, the `DELETE` statement is used to remove existing records (rows) from a table. This command allows you to specify which records to delete based on a condition.

### Simple Explanation:
- **`DELETE`**: This command is used to remove data from a table.
- You specify which table to delete from and the condition that determines which rows to delete.

### Syntax:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Important Points:
1. **WHERE Clause**: This part is crucial because it determines which records will be deleted. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all records in the table will be deleted.
2. **Caution**: Always be careful when using the `DELETE` statement, especially without a `WHERE` clause, as it can lead to loss of all data in the table.

### Example:
Let's say you have a table called `students` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, and `age`.

| id | name   | age |
|----|--------|-----|
| 1  | Alice  | 20  |
| 2  | Bob    | 22  |
| 3  | Charlie| 21  |

#### Deleting a Single Record:
If you want to delete the record for Bob, you can use the following query:

```sql
DELETE FROM students
WHERE name = 'Bob';
```

### Result:
After executing the above query, the `students` table will look like this:

| id | name   | age |
|----|--------|-----|
| 1  | Alice  | 20  |
| 3  | Charlie| 21  |

#### Deleting Multiple Records:
If you want to delete all students who are 20 years old, you can do:

```sql
DELETE FROM students
WHERE age = 20;
```

### Result:
After executing this query, the `students` table will now look like this:

| id | name   | age |
|----|--------|-----|
| 3  | Charlie| 21  |

#### Deleting All Records:
If you want to delete all records from the `students` table, you can do:

```sql
DELETE FROM students;
```

### Result:
After executing this query, the `students` table will be empty:

| id | name | age |
|----|------|-----|
|    |      |     |

### Summary:
- The `DELETE` statement is used to remove records from a MySQL table.
- You specify the table and the condition to identify which records to delete.
- Always use the `WHERE` clause to avoid unintentionally deleting all records in the table.
