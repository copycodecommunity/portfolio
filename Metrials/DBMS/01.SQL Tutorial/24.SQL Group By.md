The `GROUP BY` clause in MySQL is used to arrange identical data into groups. It is often used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc., to perform calculations on each group of data.

### How `GROUP BY` Works

1. **Select Data**: You start with a `SELECT` statement to choose the columns you want to see.
2. **Group Data**: You use `GROUP BY` to specify which column(s) you want to group the results by.
3. **Aggregate Functions**: You can use aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group.

### Example

Let's say you have a table called `sales` that looks like this:

| id | product  | quantity | price |
|----|----------|----------|-------|
| 1  | Apples   | 10       | 1.00  |
| 2  | Oranges  | 5        | 0.50  |
| 3  | Apples   | 15       | 1.00  |
| 4  | Bananas  | 7        | 0.75  |
| 5  | Oranges  | 10       | 0.50  |

### Goal

You want to find out how many of each type of fruit was sold in total.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT product**: This selects the `product` column.
- **SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity**: This calculates the total quantity sold for each product.
- **FROM sales**: This specifies the table to select data from.
- **GROUP BY product**: This groups the results by the `product` column.

### Result

After running the query, you would get a result like this:

| product  | total_quantity |
|----------|----------------|
| Apples   | 25             |
| Oranges  | 15             |
| Bananas  | 7              |

### Summary

- The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
- It is commonly used with aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group.
- In the example, we grouped the sales data by product and calculated the total quantity sold for each type of fruit.
