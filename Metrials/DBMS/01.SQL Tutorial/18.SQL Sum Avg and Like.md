In MySQL, the `SUM()` and `AVG()` functions are aggregate functions used to perform calculations on numeric data. They help you summarize data by calculating the total and average values, respectively. The `LIKE` operator is used for pattern matching in string comparisons.

### 1. SUM() Function
The `SUM()` function calculates the total sum of a numeric column.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name) AS total_sum
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### Example:
Let's say you have a table called `sales` with the following columns: `id`, `product`, and `amount`.

| id | product   | amount |
|----|-----------|--------|
| 1  | Laptop    | 1000   |
| 2  | Smartphone | 800    |
| 3  | Tablet    | 600    |
| 4  | Monitor   | 300    |
| 5  | Keyboard  | 50     |

If you want to calculate the total sales amount, you can use:

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales;
```

**Result**:
| total_sales |
|-------------|
| 2750        |

### Explanation:
- The query sums up all the values in the `amount` column, resulting in a total of 2750.

### 2. AVG() Function
The `AVG()` function calculates the average value of a numeric column.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) AS average_value
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### Example:
Using the same `sales` table, if you want to calculate the average sales amount, you can use:

```sql
SELECT AVG(amount) AS average_sales
FROM sales;
```

**Result**:
| average_sales |
|---------------|
| 550           |

### Explanation:
- The query calculates the average of the values in the `amount` column, resulting in an average of 550.

### 3. LIKE Operator
The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. It is often used with wildcard characters:
- `%`: Represents zero or more characters.
- `_`: Represents a single character.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
```

#### Example:
If you want to find all products that start with the letter "L" in the `sales` table, you can use:

```sql
SELECT product
FROM sales
WHERE product LIKE 'L%';
```

**Result**:
| product   |
|-----------|
| Laptop    |

### Explanation:
- The query searches for products in the `product` column that start with "L". The `%` wildcard allows for any characters to follow "L".

### Summary:
- **`SUM()`**: Calculates the total of a numeric column.
- **`AVG()`**: Calculates the average of a numeric column.
- **`LIKE`**: Used for pattern matching in string comparisons, allowing you to search for specific patterns in text data.
- These functions and operators are essential for data analysis and querying in MySQL, helping you summarize and filter data effectively.
