The `SELECT INTO` statement in MySQL is used to select data from one table and insert it into another table. This can be useful for creating a new table based on the results of a query or for copying data from one table to another.

### How `SELECT INTO` Works

1. **Select Data**: You write a `SELECT` statement to choose the data you want to copy.
2. **Create New Table**: You can create a new table and insert the selected data into it.
3. **Insert into Existing Table**: You can also insert the selected data into an existing table.

### Syntax

The basic syntax for creating a new table and inserting data into it is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
INTO new_table
FROM existing_table
WHERE condition;
```

### Example 1: Creating a New Table

Let's say you have a table called `employees`:

**Table: employees**

| employee_id | name      | department | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1           | Alice     | HR         | 60000  |
| 2           | Bob       | IT         | 70000  |
| 3           | Charlie   | IT         | 80000  |
| 4           | David     | Sales      | 50000  |

### Goal

You want to create a new table called `it_employees` that contains only the employees from the IT department.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
INTO it_employees
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT employee_id, name, salary**: This selects the `employee_id`, `name`, and `salary` columns.
- **INTO it_employees**: This creates a new table called `it_employees` and inserts the selected data into it.
- **FROM employees**: This specifies the source table.
- **WHERE department = 'IT'**: This filters the results to include only employees from the IT department.

### Result

After running the query, you would have a new table `it_employees` with the following data:

**Table: it_employees**

| employee_id | name    | salary |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 2           | Bob     | 70000  |
| 3           | Charlie  | 80000  |

### Example 2: Inserting into an Existing Table

If you already have a table called `high_salary_employees` and you want to insert employees with a salary greater than $60000 into it, you can use the following query:

```sql
INSERT INTO high_salary_employees (employee_id, name, salary)
SELECT employee_id, name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;
```

### Explanation

- **INSERT INTO high_salary_employees (employee_id, name, salary)**: This specifies the target table and the columns to insert data into.
- **SELECT employee_id, name, salary**: This selects the data to be inserted.
- **FROM employees**: This specifies the source table.
- **WHERE salary > 60000**: This filters the results to include only employees with a salary greater than $60000.

### Summary

- The `SELECT INTO` statement is used to create a new table and insert data into it based on a query.
- You can also use `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` to insert data into an existing table.
- This is useful for data manipulation, reporting, and creating backups.
