The `HAVING` clause in MySQL is used to filter the results of a `GROUP BY` query based on a condition. While the `WHERE` clause is used to filter records before any groupings are made, `HAVING` is applied after the grouping has been performed. This means you can use `HAVING` to filter groups based on aggregate functions.

### How `HAVING` Works

1. **Group Data**: You first group your data using `GROUP BY`.
2. **Aggregate Functions**: You can use aggregate functions to perform calculations on each group.
3. **Filter Groups**: You then use `HAVING` to filter the results based on the results of those aggregate functions.

### Example

Let's continue with the same `sales` table:

| id | product  | quantity | price |
|----|----------|----------|-------|
| 1  | Apples   | 10       | 1.00  |
| 2  | Oranges  | 5        | 0.50  |
| 3  | Apples   | 15       | 1.00  |
| 4  | Bananas  | 7        | 0.75  |
| 5  | Oranges  | 10       | 0.50  |

### Goal

Suppose you want to find out which products have a total quantity sold greater than 10.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
HAVING total_quantity > 10;
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT product**: This selects the `product` column.
- **SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity**: This calculates the total quantity sold for each product.
- **FROM sales**: This specifies the table to select data from.
- **GROUP BY product**: This groups the results by the `product` column.
- **HAVING total_quantity > 10**: This filters the groups to only include those where the total quantity is greater than 10.

### Result

After running the query, you would get a result like this:

| product  | total_quantity |
|----------|----------------|
| Apples   | 25             |

### Summary

- The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups created by `GROUP BY` based on aggregate function results.
- It allows you to specify conditions on the aggregated data.
- In the example, we grouped the sales data by product and then filtered to show only those products with a total quantity sold greater than 10.
