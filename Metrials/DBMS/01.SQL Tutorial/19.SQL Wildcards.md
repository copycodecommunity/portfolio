In MySQL, wildcards are special characters used in conjunction with the `LIKE` operator to search for patterns in string data. They allow you to perform flexible searches by matching a variety of string patterns.

### Common Wildcards:
1. **`%` (Percent Sign)**: Represents zero or more characters.
2. **`_` (Underscore)**: Represents a single character.

### Using Wildcards with the `LIKE` Operator:
The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

### Examples:

#### 1. Using `%` Wildcard
The `%` wildcard can match any sequence of characters, including no characters at all.

**Example**: Find all products that contain the word "phone" anywhere in their name.

Assuming you have a table called `products`:

| id | name            |
|----|-----------------|
| 1  | Smartphone      |
| 2  | Laptop          |
| 3  | Landline Phone  |
| 4  | Tablet          |
| 5  | Wireless Phone   |

You can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%phone%';
```

**Result**:
| id | name            |
|----|-----------------|
| 1  | Smartphone      |
| 3  | Landline Phone  |
| 5  | Wireless Phone   |

### Explanation:
- The query returns all products where the name contains the substring "phone". The `%` wildcard allows for any characters before and after "phone".

#### 2. Using `_` Wildcard
The `_` wildcard matches exactly one character.

**Example**: Find all products that have a name with exactly 6 characters and start with "L".

Using the same `products` table, you can use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE 'L_____' ;
```

**Result**:
| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 2  | Laptop |

### Explanation:
- The query returns products where the name starts with "L" and has exactly 5 more characters (totaling 6 characters). The `_` wildcard represents each of the 5 characters.

#### 3. Combining Wildcards
You can combine both wildcards in a single query.

**Example**: Find all products that start with "L" and have "t" as the third character.

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE 'L_t%';
```

**Result**:
| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 2  | Laptop |

### Explanation:
- The query returns products where the name starts with "L", has "t" as the third character, and can have any characters following it. The `_` wildcard matches exactly one character, while `%` matches any sequence of characters.

### Summary:
- Wildcards in MySQL are used with the `LIKE` operator to perform flexible pattern matching in string searches.
- The `%` wildcard matches zero or more characters, while the `_` wildcard matches exactly one character.
- These wildcards are useful for searching and filtering string data in a database, allowing for more dynamic queries.
