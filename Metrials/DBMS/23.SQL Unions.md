In MySQL, the `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. The `UNION` operator removes duplicate rows by default, meaning that if the same row appears in both result sets, it will only be included once in the final output.

### Simple Explanation:
- **`UNION`**: Combines the results of multiple `SELECT` queries into one result set, eliminating duplicate rows.

### Important Points:
1. **Same Number of Columns**: Each `SELECT` statement must have the same number of columns in the result sets, and the columns must have compatible data types.
2. **Column Names**: The column names in the final result set are taken from the first `SELECT` statement.
3. **Order of Results**: You can use the `ORDER BY` clause at the end of the combined query to sort the final result set.

### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

### Example:
Let's say you have two tables: `employees` and `contractors`.

**employees** table:
| id | name   | role       |
|----|--------|------------|
| 1  | Alice  | Developer  |
| 2  | Bob    | Manager    |
| 3  | Charlie| Developer  |

**contractors** table:
| id | name   | role       |
|----|--------|------------|
| 1  | David  | Consultant  |
| 2  | Eva    | Developer  |
| 3  | Frank  | Manager    |

#### Using UNION to Combine Results:
If you want to get a list of all individuals (both employees and contractors) who have the role of "Developer", you can use the `UNION` operator:

```sql
SELECT name, role
FROM employees
WHERE role = 'Developer'
UNION
SELECT name, role
FROM contractors
WHERE role = 'Developer';
```

**Result**:
| name    | role      |
|---------|-----------|
| Alice   | Developer |
| Charlie | Developer |
| Eva     | Developer |

### Explanation:
- The first `SELECT` statement retrieves employees with the role of "Developer".
- The second `SELECT` statement retrieves contractors with the same role.
- The `UNION` operator combines the results, removing any duplicates (if any).

### Using UNION ALL:
If you want to include all duplicates in the result set, you can use `UNION ALL`. This will return all rows from both queries, including duplicates.

#### Example with UNION ALL:
```sql
SELECT name, role
FROM employees
WHERE role = 'Developer'
UNION ALL
SELECT name, role
FROM contractors
WHERE role = 'Developer';
```

**Result**:
| name    | role      |
|---------|-----------|
| Alice   | Developer |
| Charlie | Developer |
| Eva     | Developer |

### Summary:
- The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of multiple `SELECT` statements into a single result set, removing duplicates.
- Each `SELECT` must have the same number of columns with compatible data types.
- You can use `UNION ALL` if you want to include all duplicates in the final result.
- This operator is useful for consolidating data from different sources or tables into a unified view.
