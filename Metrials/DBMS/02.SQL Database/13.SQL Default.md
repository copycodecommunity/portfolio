The **CHECK** constraint in SQL is used to limit the values that can be placed in a column. It ensures that all values in a column meet a specific condition. This helps maintain data integrity by enforcing rules on the data that can be entered into the table.

### Simple Explanation

1. **What is CHECK?**
   - The CHECK constraint is a rule that specifies a condition that must be met for the values in a column. If a value does not meet the condition, the database will reject the insert or update operation.

2. **Why Use CHECK?**
   - To enforce specific rules on the data, such as ensuring that a numeric value falls within a certain range or that a string matches a specific pattern.

### Example of Using CHECK with a Table

Let’s create a table named `Products` that includes a CHECK constraint to ensure that the `Price` column contains only positive values and that the `Stock` column is not negative.

#### Step 1: Create the Table

Here’s how you can create a `Products` table with CHECK constraints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,            -- Primary Key constraint
    ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,   -- NOT NULL constraint
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Price > 0),  -- CHECK constraint for positive price
    Stock INT CHECK (Stock >= 0)          -- CHECK constraint for non-negative stock
);
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY`: This column is the primary key, meaning it must be unique and cannot be NULL.
  - `ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`: This column cannot have NULL values; every product must have a name.
  - `Price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Price > 0)`: This CHECK constraint ensures that the `Price` must be greater than 0 (i.e., positive).
  - `Stock INT CHECK (Stock >= 0)`: This CHECK constraint ensures that the `Stock` must be greater than or equal to 0 (i.e., non-negative).

#### Step 2: Inserting Valid Data

Now, let’s try to insert some valid data into the `Products` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Stock) VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 999.99, 10),
(2, 'Smartphone', 499.99, 25);
```

- The above inserts will succeed because the `Price` and `Stock` values meet the CHECK constraints.

#### Step 3: Violating the CHECK Constraint

Now, let’s see what happens if we try to insert records that violate the CHECK constraints:

1. **Inserting an Invalid Price**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Stock) VALUES
   (3, 'Tablet', -150.00, 5);
   ```
   - This will fail with an error because the `Price` cannot be negative (it violates the CHECK constraint).

2. **Inserting an Invalid Stock**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price, Stock) VALUES
   (4, 'Headphones', 89.99, -10);
   ```
   - This will also fail with an error because the `Stock` cannot be negative (it violates the CHECK constraint).

### Summary

In this example, we created a `Products` table with CHECK constraints on the `Price` and `Stock` columns to ensure that the price is always positive and the stock is never negative. The CHECK constraint is essential for maintaining data integrity by enforcing specific rules on the data that can be entered into the table. It helps ensure that only valid data is stored in the database.
