A **FOREIGN KEY** in SQL is a constraint that creates a link between two tables. It ensures that the value in one table (the child table) matches a value in another table (the parent table). This relationship helps maintain referential integrity in the database.

### Simple Explanation

1. **What is a FOREIGN KEY?**
   - A FOREIGN KEY is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.

2. **Why Use a FOREIGN KEY?**
   - To ensure that the data in the child table corresponds to valid data in the parent table. It prevents orphaned records and maintains data integrity.

3. **Characteristics of a FOREIGN KEY:**
   - It can accept NULL values unless specified otherwise.
   - It must match a value in the referenced table's PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE column.

### Example of Using FOREIGN KEY

Let’s create two tables: `Students` and `Enrollments`. The `Enrollments` table will have a FOREIGN KEY that references the `Students` table.

#### Step 1: Create the Parent Table (Students)

Here’s how you can create the `Students` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,          -- Primary Key constraint
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,    -- NOT NULL constraint
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL       -- NOT NULL constraint
);
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY`: This column is the primary key for the `Students` table.

#### Step 2: Create the Child Table (Enrollments)

Now, let’s create the `Enrollments` table with a FOREIGN KEY that references the `StudentID` in the `Students` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,        -- Primary Key constraint
    StudentID INT,                       -- This will be the foreign key
    CourseName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,   -- NOT NULL constraint
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID) -- Foreign Key constraint
);
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY`: This column is the primary key for the `Enrollments` table.
  - `StudentID INT`: This column will store the ID of the student enrolled in a course.
  - `FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID)`: This establishes a foreign key relationship, linking `StudentID` in the `Enrollments` table to `StudentID` in the `Students` table.

#### Step 3: Inserting Data into the Parent Table

Now, let’s insert some data into the `Students` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, FirstName, LastName) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith');
```

#### Step 4: Inserting Data into the Child Table

Next, we can insert data into the `Enrollments` table, referencing the `StudentID` from the `Students` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseName) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Mathematics'),
(2, 2, 'Science');
```

- The above inserts will succeed because the `StudentID` values (1 and 2) exist in the `Students` table.

#### Step 5: Violating the FOREIGN KEY Constraint

Now, let’s see what happens if we try to insert a record into the `Enrollments` table that violates the FOREIGN KEY constraint:

```sql
INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseName) VALUES
(3, 3, 'History');
```

- This will fail with an error because `StudentID` value `3` does not exist in the `Students` table, violating the FOREIGN KEY constraint.

### Summary

In this example, we created two tables: `Students` (the parent table) and `Enrollments` (the child table). The `Enrollments` table has a FOREIGN KEY that references the `StudentID` in the `Students` table, ensuring that every enrollment corresponds to a valid student. The FOREIGN KEY constraint helps maintain referential integrity by preventing orphaned records and ensuring that relationships between tables are valid.
