SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate a SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code into an input field. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data, data modification, or even deletion.

### How SQL Injection Works

When a web application constructs a SQL query using user input without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker can input specially crafted SQL code that alters the intended query. 

### Example of SQL Injection

Let's consider a simple example where a web application allows users to log in by entering their username and password. The application might construct a SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = 'user_input' AND Password = 'password_input';
```

If the application directly uses user input without sanitization, an attacker could input the following as the username:

```sql
' OR '1'='1
```

And any password (e.g., `password_input`). The resulting SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '' OR '1'='1' AND Password = 'password_input';
```

### Result of the Injection

The condition `'1'='1'` is always true, so the query would return all users in the `Users` table, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.

### Preventing SQL Injection

To prevent SQL injection, you should follow these best practices:

1. **Use Prepared Statements**: Prepared statements ensure that user input is treated as data, not executable code. For example, in PHP with PDO:

   ```php
   $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = :username AND Password = :password");
   $stmt->execute(['username' => $user_input, 'password' => $password_input]);
   ```

2. **Use Stored Procedures**: Stored procedures can encapsulate SQL logic and separate it from user input.

3. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Ensure that they conform to expected formats.

4. **Least Privilege Principle**: Limit database user permissions to only what is necessary for the application.

5. **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**: Use WAFs to help detect and block SQL injection attempts.

### Conclusion

SQL injection is a serious security threat that can lead to significant data breaches and unauthorized access. By following best practices such as using prepared statements, validating input, and employing security measures, you can protect your applications from SQL injection attacks.
