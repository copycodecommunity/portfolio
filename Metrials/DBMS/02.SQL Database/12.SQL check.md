The **CHECK** constraint in SQL is used to limit the values that can be placed in a column. It ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition. This helps maintain data integrity by enforcing rules on the data that can be entered into the table.

### Simple Explanation

1. **What is CHECK?**
   - The CHECK constraint is a rule that specifies a condition that must be met for the values in a column. If a value does not meet the condition, the database will reject the insert or update operation.

2. **Why Use CHECK?**
   - To enforce specific rules on the data, such as ensuring that a numeric value falls within a certain range or that a string matches a specific pattern.

### Example of Using CHECK

Let’s create a table named `Employees` that includes a CHECK constraint to ensure that the `Age` column contains only valid values.

#### Step 1: Create the Table

Here’s how you can create an `Employees` table with a CHECK constraint on the `Age` column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,          -- Primary Key constraint
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     -- NOT NULL constraint
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,      -- NOT NULL constraint
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18 AND Age <= 65),  -- CHECK constraint
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE            -- Unique constraint
);
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY`: This column is the primary key, meaning it must be unique and cannot be NULL.
  - `FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL`: This column cannot have NULL values; every employee must have a first name.
  - `LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL`: This column also cannot have NULL values; every employee must have a last name.
  - `Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18 AND Age <= 65)`: This CHECK constraint ensures that the `Age` must be between 18 and 65, inclusive.
  - `Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE`: This column must have unique values, meaning no two employees can have the same email address.

#### Step 2: Inserting Valid Data

Now, let’s try to insert some valid data into the `Employees` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Email) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 30, 'john.doe@example.com'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 25, 'jane.smith@example.com');
```

- The above inserts will succeed because the ages (30 and 25) meet the CHECK constraint.

#### Step 3: Violating the CHECK Constraint

Now, let’s see what happens if we try to insert a record that violates the CHECK constraint:

1. **Inserting an Invalid Age**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Email) VALUES
   (3, 'Alice', 'Brown', 17, 'alice.brown@example.com');
   ```
   - This will fail with an error because the age `17` does not satisfy the CHECK constraint (it is less than 18).

2. **Inserting Another Invalid Age**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Email) VALUES
   (4, 'Charlie', 'Green', 70, 'charlie.green@example.com');
   ```
   - This will also fail with an error because the age `70` does not satisfy the CHECK constraint (it is greater than 65).

### Summary

In this example, we created an `Employees` table with a CHECK constraint on the `Age` column to ensure that every employee's age is between 18 and 65. The CHECK constraint is essential for maintaining data integrity by enforcing specific rules on the data that can be entered into the table. It helps ensure that only valid data is stored in the database.
