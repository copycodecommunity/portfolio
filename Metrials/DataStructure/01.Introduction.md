In C++, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. C++ provides a wide range of built-in and user-defined data structures. Here's an introduction to some commonly used data structures in C++ along with explanations:

1. **Array:**
   - An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Accessing elements in an array is done using an index.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
     ```

2. **Vector:**
   - A dynamic array that can resize itself automatically.
   - Provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) in the `<vector>` header.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <vector>
     std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
     ```

3. **Linked List:**
   - A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
   - Dynamic size and efficient insertion and deletion.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     struct Node {
         int data;
         Node* next;
     };
     ```

4. **Stack:**
   - A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end (top).
   - Common operations: push (add) and pop (remove).
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <stack>
     std::stack<int> myStack;
     ```

5. **Queue:**
   - A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
   - Common operations: enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove).
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <queue>
     std::queue<int> myQueue;
     ```

6. **Deque (Double-Ended Queue):**
   - Similar to a queue but allows insertion and deletion at both ends.
   - Provided by the C++ STL in the `<deque>` header.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <deque>
     std::deque<int> myDeque;
     ```

7. **Map (Associative Array):**
   - A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique.
   - Provides fast lookup based on keys.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <map>
     std::map<std::string, int> myMap;
     ```

8. **Set:**
   - A collection of unique elements.
   - Provides fast lookup for the presence of an element.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <set>
     std::set<int> mySet;
     ```

9. **Hash Table:**
   - A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.
   - Provides fast insertion and retrieval.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <unordered_map>
     std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myHashTable;
     ```

10. **Tree:**
    - A hierarchical data structure composed of nodes.
    - Examples include Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, and Red-Black Tree.
    - Example (Binary Search Tree):

      ```cpp
      struct TreeNode {
          int data;
          TreeNode* left;
          TreeNode* right;
      };
      ```

These are just a few examples of data structures in C++. Choosing the right data structure depends on the specific requirements of your program and the operations you need to perform efficiently. The C++ STL provides a rich set of standard data structures that can be readily used in your programs.
