### What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is often used to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems. A recursive function typically has two main components:

1. **Base Case**: This is the condition under which the recursion stops. It prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely.
2. **Recursive Case**: This is the part of the function where the function calls itself with modified arguments, moving towards the base case.

### Why Use Recursion?

1. **Simplicity**: Recursive solutions can be more straightforward and easier to understand than their iterative counterparts, especially for problems that have a natural recursive structure (like tree traversals).
2. **Reduction of Code**: Recursive functions can often be written in fewer lines of code compared to iterative solutions.

### Example of Recursion

Let’s look at a classic example of recursion: calculating the factorial of a number.

#### Factorial Example

The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). It is denoted as \( n! \) and is defined as follows:

- \( n! = n \times (n-1)! \) for \( n > 0 \)
- \( 0! = 1 \) (base case)

Here’s how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function to calculate factorial
int factorial(int n) {
    // Base case
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1; // 0! is 1
    } else {
        // Recursive case
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // n! = n * (n-1)!
    }
}

int main() {
    int number;

    cout << "Enter a non-negative integer: ";
    cin >> number;

    if (number < 0) {
        cout << "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Factorial of " << number << " is: " << factorial(number) << endl;
    }

    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `factorial(int n)` calculates the factorial of the integer `n`.
   - **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, the function returns 1, as \( 0! = 1 \).
   - **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 0, the function calls itself with the argument `n - 1` and multiplies the result by `n`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a non-negative integer.
   - The program checks if the number is negative and displays an appropriate message if it is.
   - If the number is valid, it calls the `factorial` function and prints the result.

### Another Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is another classic example of recursion. The sequence is defined as follows:

- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n > 1 \)

Here’s how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function to calculate Fibonacci number
int fibonacci(int n) {
    // Base cases
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        // Recursive case
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}

int main() {
    int number;

    cout << "Enter a non-negative integer: ";
    cin >> number;

    if (number < 0) {
        cout << "Fibonacci is not defined for negative numbers." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << number << " is: " << fibonacci(number) << endl;
    }

    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```

### Explanation of the Fibonacci Example

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `fibonacci(int n)` calculates the Fibonacci number at position `n`.
   - **Base Cases**: If `n` is 0, it returns 0; if `n` is 1, it returns 1.
   - **Recursive Case**: For values greater than 1, it calls itself twice: once with `n - 1` and once with `n - 2`, and adds the results.

### Pros and Cons of Recursion

#### Pros:
- **Simplicity**: Recursive solutions can be more intuitive and easier to implement for problems that have a recursive nature.
- **Cleaner Code**: Recursive functions can often be shorter and more elegant than their iterative counterparts.

#### Cons:
- **Performance**: Recursive functions can be less efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of multiple function calls and the risk of stack overflow for deep recursion.
- **Memory Usage**: Each recursive call consumes stack space, which can lead to higher memory usage compared to iterative solutions.

### Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful technique in C++ that allows you to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. By understanding how to implement recursive functions, you can tackle a wide range of problems more effectively. However, it's essential to be aware of the potential performance implications and to use recursion judiciously.
