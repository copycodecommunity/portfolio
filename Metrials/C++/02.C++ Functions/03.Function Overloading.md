### What is Function Overloading?

Function overloading is a feature in C++ that allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This means you can have several functions that perform similar tasks but take different types or numbers of arguments. The compiler determines which function to call based on the arguments passed.

### Why Use Function Overloading?

1. **Improved Readability**: You can use the same function name for similar operations, making the code easier to read and understand.
2. **Flexibility**: It allows functions to handle different types of input without needing different names.

### Rules for Function Overloading

1. **Different Parameter Types**: Functions must have different types of parameters.
2. **Different Number of Parameters**: Functions can have a different number of parameters.
3. **Return Type Alone is Not Sufficient**: You cannot overload functions based solely on their return type.

### Example of Function Overloading

Letâ€™s create a simple example that demonstrates function overloading by defining a function named `add` that can add two integers, two floats, or three integers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to add two integers
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Function to add two floats
float add(float a, float b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Function to add three integers
int add(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

int main() {
    int intResult = add(5, 10); // Calls the first add function
    float floatResult = add(5.5f, 4.5f); // Calls the second add function
    int intTripleResult = add(1, 2, 3); // Calls the third add function

    // Displaying the results
    cout << "Sum of two integers: " << intResult << endl;
    cout << "Sum of two floats: " << floatResult << endl;
    cout << "Sum of three integers: " << intTripleResult << endl;

    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `int add(int a, int b)`: This function adds two integers.
   - `float add(float a, float b)`: This function adds two floats.
   - `int add(int a, int b, int c)`: This function adds three integers.

2. **Function Calls**:
   - In the `main` function, we call the `add` function with different types and numbers of arguments.
   - The compiler determines which version of the `add` function to call based on the arguments provided.

3. **Output**:
   - The program will output the results of the different additions, demonstrating that the same function name can be used for different operations.

### Conclusion

Function overloading is a powerful feature in C++ that allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This enhances code readability and flexibility, making it easier to work with similar operations.
