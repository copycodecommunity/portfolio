### What are Access Specifiers?

Access specifiers in C++ are keywords that determine the accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). They control how and where the members of a class can be accessed from outside the class. The three main access specifiers in C++ are:

1. **public**: Members declared as public are accessible from outside the class. They can be accessed by any function or object.

2. **private**: Members declared as private are accessible only within the class itself. They cannot be accessed from outside the class, which helps in encapsulating the data.

3. **protected**: Members declared as protected are accessible within the class and by derived classes (subclasses). They cannot be accessed from outside the class unless through a derived class.

### Example of Access Specifiers

Letâ€™s create a simple example using a class called `Student` to demonstrate the use of access specifiers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name; // Private attribute
    int age;     // Private attribute

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    Student(string studentName, int studentAge) {
        name = studentName;
        age = studentAge;
    }

    // Public method to display student information
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << age << " years" << endl;
    }

    // Public method to set the student's name
    void setName(string studentName) {
        name = studentName;
    }

    // Public method to get the student's name
    string getName() {
        return name;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating an object of the Student class
    Student student1("Sahil Khan", 23);

    // Accessing public method to display information
    student1.displayInfo();

    // Accessing public method to change the name
    student1.setName("John Doe");
    cout << "Updated Name: " << student1.getName() << endl;

    // The following line would cause a compilation error because 'name' is private
    // cout << student1.name << endl; // Uncommenting this line will cause an error

    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Class Definition**:
   - We define a class named `Student` with two private attributes: `name` and `age`. These attributes cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor `Student(string studentName, int studentAge)` initializes the `name` and `age` attributes with the values provided when the object is created.

3. **Public Methods**:
   - `displayInfo()`: This public method prints the student's name and age. It can be called from outside the class.
   - `setName(string studentName)`: This public method allows changing the student's name.
   - `getName()`: This public method returns the student's name.

4. **Creating an Object**:
   - In the `main` function, we create an object of the `Student` class named `student1` and initialize it with the name "Sahil Khan" and age 23.

5. **Accessing Public Methods**:
   - We call the `displayInfo()` method to display the student's information.
   - We call the `setName()` method to change the student's name to "John Doe" and then use `getName()` to retrieve and display the updated name.

6. **Private Access**:
   - The private attributes `name` and `age` cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. If you try to access `student1.name`, it will result in a compilation error.

### Summary of Access Specifiers

- **public**: Members are accessible from anywhere in the program.
- **private**: Members are accessible only within the class itself.
- **protected**: Members are accessible within the class and by derived classes.

### Conclusion

Access specifiers are an essential part of C++ that help in implementing encapsulation, one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). By controlling access to class members, you can protect the integrity of the data and provide a clear interface for interacting with objects.
