### What is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or class. Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.

### Key Features of Encapsulation

1. **Data Hiding**: By making class attributes private, you can hide the internal state of the object from the outside world. This prevents external code from directly accessing and modifying the data, which helps maintain the integrity of the object.

2. **Controlled Access**: Encapsulation allows you to control how the data is accessed and modified. You can provide public methods (getters and setters) to allow controlled access to private attributes.

3. **Improved Maintainability**: Encapsulation makes it easier to change the internal implementation of a class without affecting external code that uses the class. As long as the public interface remains the same, you can modify the internal workings without breaking existing code.

### Example of Encapsulation

Letâ€™s create a simple example using a class called `BankAccount` to demonstrate encapsulation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class BankAccount {
private:
    string accountNumber; // Private attribute to store account number
    double balance;        // Private attribute to store account balance

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the account
    BankAccount(string accNumber, double initialBalance) {
        accountNumber = accNumber;
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Public method to deposit money
    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount; // Increase balance
            cout << "Deposited: $" << amount << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Invalid deposit amount!" << endl;
        }
    }

    // Public method to withdraw money
    void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount; // Decrease balance
            cout << "Withdrew: $" << amount << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Invalid withdrawal amount!" << endl;
        }
    }

    // Public method to display account information
    void displayAccountInfo() {
        cout << "Account Number: " << accountNumber << endl;
        cout << "Balance: $" << balance << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating a BankAccount object
    BankAccount myAccount("123456789", 1000.0);

    // Displaying account information
    myAccount.displayAccountInfo();

    // Depositing money
    myAccount.deposit(500.0);
    myAccount.displayAccountInfo();

    // Withdrawing money
    myAccount.withdraw(200.0);
    myAccount.displayAccountInfo();

    // Attempting to withdraw more than the balance
    myAccount.withdraw(1500.0);

    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Class Definition**:
   - We define a class named `BankAccount` with two private attributes: `accountNumber` and `balance`. These attributes cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor `BankAccount(string accNumber, double initialBalance)` initializes the `accountNumber` and `balance` attributes when a `BankAccount` object is created.

3. **Public Methods**:
   - `deposit(double amount)`: This method allows the user to deposit money into the account. It checks if the amount is valid before updating the balance.
   - `withdraw(double amount)`: This method allows the user to withdraw money from the account. It checks if the withdrawal amount is valid and does not exceed the current balance.
   - `displayAccountInfo()`: This method displays the account number and balance.

4. **Creating an Object**:
   - In the `main` function, we create a `BankAccount` object named `myAccount` and initialize it with an account number and an initial balance.

5. **Using the Object**:
   - We call the `displayAccountInfo()` method to show the account details.
   - We call the `deposit()` method to add money to the account and then display the updated information.
   - We call the `withdraw()` method to withdraw money and display the updated information.
   - We also demonstrate error handling by attempting to withdraw more than the available balance.

### Benefits of Encapsulation

1. **Data Protection**: Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object from unintended modifications.
2. **Controlled Access**: It allows you to control how the data is accessed and modified through public methods.
3. **Flexibility and Maintainability**: Changes to the internal implementation can be made without affecting external code, as long as the public interface remains the same.

### Conclusion

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming that helps in protecting the internal state of an object and controlling access to its data. By using encapsulation, you can create robust and maintainable code that is easier to understand and work with.
