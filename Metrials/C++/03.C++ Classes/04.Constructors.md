### What is a Constructor?

A **constructor** is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes (data members) and allocate resources if needed. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

### Characteristics of Constructors

1. **Same Name as Class**: The constructor must have the same name as the class.
2. **No Return Type**: Constructors do not have a return type, not even `void`.
3. **Automatically Called**: Constructors are called automatically when an object is created.
4. **Can Be Overloaded**: You can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists (constructor overloading).

### Types of Constructors

1. **Default Constructor**: A constructor that takes no parameters. It initializes the object with default values.
2. **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor that takes parameters to initialize an object with specific values.
3. **Copy Constructor**: A constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.

### Example of Constructors

Letâ€™s create a simple example of a `Person` class that demonstrates both a default constructor and a parameterized constructor.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Class definition
class Person {
private:
    string name; // Attribute to store the person's name
    int age;     // Attribute to store the person's age

public:
    // Default constructor
    Person() {
        name = "Unknown"; // Initialize with default name
        age = 0;          // Initialize with default age
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    Person(string personName, int personAge) {
        name = personName; // Initialize name with provided value
        age = personAge;   // Initialize age with provided value
    }

    // Method to display person's information
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << age << " years" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating an object using the default constructor
    Person person1; // name will be "Unknown" and age will be 0
    person1.displayInfo();

    // Creating an object using the parameterized constructor
    Person person2("Sahil Khan", 23); // name is "Sahil Khan" and age is 23
    person2.displayInfo();

    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Class Definition**:
   - We define a class named `Person` with two private attributes: `name` (to store the person's name) and `age` (to store the person's age).

2. **Default Constructor**:
   - The default constructor `Person()` initializes the `name` attribute to "Unknown" and the `age` attribute to 0. This constructor is called when an object is created without any arguments.

3. **Parameterized Constructor**:
   - The parameterized constructor `Person(string personName, int personAge)` initializes the `name` and `age` attributes with the values provided when the object is created. This constructor is called when an object is created with specific values.

4. **Method**:
   - `displayInfo()`: This method prints the person's name and age.

5. **Creating Objects**:
   - In the `main` function, we create two `Person` objects:
     - `person1` is created using the default constructor, so its name is "Unknown" and age is 0.
     - `person2` is created using the parameterized constructor with the name "Sahil Khan" and age 23.

6. **Calling Methods**:
   - We call the `displayInfo()` method on both objects to display their information.

### Output

When you run this program, the output will be:

```
Name: Unknown
Age: 0 years
Name: Sahil Khan
Age: 23 years
```

### Conclusion

Constructors are a fundamental concept in C++ that allow you to initialize objects when they are created. By using default and parameterized constructors, you can create objects with specific initial values or default values. This helps in organizing your code and ensuring that objects are in a valid state when they are used.
