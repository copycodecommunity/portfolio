### What are Class Methods?

Class methods (also known as member functions) are functions that are defined within a class and operate on the data (attributes) of that class. They can access and manipulate the class's attributes and provide functionality related to the class.

### Types of Class Methods

1. **Instance Methods**: These are the most common type of methods. They operate on instances (objects) of the class and can access instance variables (attributes).

2. **Static Methods**: These methods belong to the class itself rather than any specific object. They can be called without creating an instance of the class and can only access static variables.

3. **Const Methods**: These methods do not modify the object on which they are called. They are declared with the `const` keyword at the end of the method declaration.

### Defining Class Methods

Here’s the basic syntax for defining class methods:

```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    returnType methodName(parameters) {
        // method body
    }
};
```

### Example of Class Methods

Let’s create a simple example that demonstrates instance methods, static methods, and const methods using a class called `Circle`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // For M_PI
using namespace std;

class Circle {
private:
    double radius; // Attribute to store the radius of the circle

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the radius
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    // Instance method to calculate the area of the circle
    double calculateArea() {
        return M_PI * radius * radius; // Area = π * r^2
    }

    // Instance method to calculate the circumference of the circle
    double calculateCircumference() {
        return 2 * M_PI * radius; // Circumference = 2 * π * r
    }

    // Static method to compare two circles based on their radius
    static bool compareCircles(Circle c1, Circle c2) {
        return c1.radius == c2.radius; // Compare the radii
    }

    // Const method to get the radius (does not modify the object)
    double getRadius() const {
        return radius;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating two Circle objects
    Circle circle1(5.0);
    Circle circle2(3.0);

    // Calling instance methods
    cout << "Area of circle1: " << circle1.calculateArea() << endl;
    cout << "Circumference of circle1: " << circle1.calculateCircumference() << endl;

    cout << "Area of circle2: " << circle2.calculateArea() << endl;
    cout << "Circumference of circle2: " << circle2.calculateCircumference() << endl;

    // Calling static method
    if (Circle::compareCircles(circle1, circle2)) {
        cout << "Both circles have the same radius." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The circles have different radii." << endl;
    }

    // Calling const method
    cout << "Radius of circle1: " << circle1.getRadius() << endl;

    return 0; // Indicate that the program ended successfully
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Class Definition**:
   - We define a class named `Circle` with a private attribute `radius` to store the radius of the circle.

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor `Circle(double r)` initializes the `radius` attribute when a `Circle` object is created.

3. **Instance Methods**:
   - `calculateArea()`: This method calculates and returns the area of the circle using the formula \( \pi r^2 \).
   - `calculateCircumference()`: This method calculates and returns the circumference of the circle using the formula \( 2\pi r \).

4. **Static Method**:
   - `compareCircles(Circle c1, Circle c2)`: This static method compares the radii of two `Circle` objects and returns `true` if they are equal, otherwise `false`. It can be called without creating an instance of the class.

5. **Const Method**:
   - `getRadius() const`: This method returns the radius of the circle. It is declared as a `const` method, meaning it does not modify the object.

6. **Creating Objects**:
   - In the `main` function, we create two `Circle` objects, `circle1` and `circle2`, with different radii.

7. **Calling Methods**:
   - We call the instance methods to calculate and display the area and circumference of each circle.
   - We call the static method to compare the two circles.
   - We call the const method to get the radius of `circle1`.

### Conclusion

Class methods are essential for defining the behavior of objects in C++. They allow you to encapsulate functionality within a class, making your code more organized and modular. By understanding instance methods, static methods, and const methods, you can effectively design and implement classes in your C++ programs.
