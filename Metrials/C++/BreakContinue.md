In C++, `break` and `continue` are control flow statements used within loops to alter the program's flow. Here's an explanation of `break` and `continue`:

1. **`break` Statement:**
   - The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. It terminates the loop in which it is placed and transfers control to the statement following the loop.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
       if (i == 5) {
           break; // exit the loop when i is 5
       }
       cout << i << " ";
   }
   ```

   In the example above, the loop will print numbers from 0 to 4. When `i` becomes 5, the `break` statement is encountered, and the loop is terminated.

2. **`continue` Statement:**
   - The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
       if (i == 5) {
           continue; // skip the rest of the loop when i is 5
       }
       cout << i << " ";
   }
   ```

   In this example, when `i` is equal to 5, the `continue` statement is executed, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration without executing the `cout` statement for that iteration.

3. **Usage in Nested Loops:**
   - Both `break` and `continue` can be used in nested loops. When used in nested loops, they affect the innermost loop that contains them.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
       for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j) {
           if (j == 3) {
               break; // exit the inner loop when j is 3
           }
           cout << "(" << i << "," << j << ") ";
       }
       cout << endl;
   }
   ```

   In this example, when `j` is equal to 3, the `break` statement only exits the inner loop, allowing the outer loop to continue.

4. **`break` and `continue` with Labels:**
   - C++ allows using labels with `break` and `continue` to specify which loop should be affected, especially in nested loops.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
       for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j) {
           if (j == 3) {
               break; // exit the inner loop
           }
           cout << "(" << i << "," << j << ") ";
       }
       cout << endl;
   }
   ```

   In this case, the `break` statement with the label `outerLoop` would exit the outer loop when `j` is 3.

`break` and `continue` provide a way to control the flow of execution within loops and are useful in scenarios where you need to prematurely exit a loop or skip specific iterations.
