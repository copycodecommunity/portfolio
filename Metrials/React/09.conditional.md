In functional React components, conditional rendering is a technique where you decide whether or not to render a part of your UI based on a condition. This can be achieved using various methods in JavaScript. Here's an example using the conditional (ternary) operator and the logical AND (`&&`) operator within a functional React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ConditionalComponent = ({ condition }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {condition ? (
        <p>This content is rendered when the condition is true.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>This content is rendered when the condition is false.</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ConditionalComponent;
```

Explanation:

1. **Functional Component Declaration:**
   - We declare a functional component named `ConditionalComponent` that takes a prop named `condition`.

2. **Conditional Rendering:**
   - Inside the component, we use the curly braces `{}` to embed JavaScript expressions.
   - We use the ternary (conditional) operator (`? :`) to conditionally render different content based on the value of the `condition` prop.
   - If `condition` is true, the first part (before `:`) is rendered; otherwise, the second part is rendered.

3. **JSX Elements:**
   - We have two JSX elements inside the ternary operator, each containing a `<p>` (paragraph) element with different content.
   - This is the content that will be rendered conditionally based on the value of the `condition` prop.

4. **Return Statement:**
   - The component returns a single JSX element, which contains the conditional rendering logic.

Usage:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ConditionalComponent from './ConditionalComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Conditional Rendering Example</h1>
      <ConditionalComponent condition={true} />
      {/* Renders the first paragraph since condition is true */}
      <ConditionalComponent condition={false} />
      {/* Renders the second paragraph since condition is false */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the `ConditionalComponent` is used twice with different values for the `condition` prop to demonstrate both true and false cases. Depending on the value of the condition, different content will be rendered within the component.
