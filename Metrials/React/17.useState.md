In React, the `useState` hook is a crucial part of functional components. It allows functional components to manage state, enabling them to hold and update data over time. Here's an explanation of how to use `useState` in a functional React component:

1. **Import the `useState` Hook:**
   First, make sure to import the `useState` hook from the 'react' library.

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Declare State Variable:**
   Declare a state variable using the `useState` hook. The hook takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state.

   ```javascript
   function ExampleComponent() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
   }
   ```

   In this example, `count` is the state variable, and `setCount` is the function to update its value. The initial state is set to `0`.

3. **Access State Variable:**
   You can access the current state value (`count` in this case) in your component's JSX or any other part of your component.

   ```javascript
   function ExampleComponent() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Count: {count}</p>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   Here, the current value of `count` is displayed in the JSX.

4. **Update State:**
   To update the state, use the provided function (`setCount` in this case). This function can be called with a new value, and it will re-render the component with the updated state.

   ```javascript
   function ExampleComponent() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     const increment = () => {
       setCount(count + 1);
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Count: {count}</p>
         <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   In this example, clicking the "Increment" button calls the `increment` function, which updates the `count` state.

The `useState` hook allows functional components to manage local state, making them more powerful and versatile. Remember that the initial state can be a primitive value, an object, or even a function that computes the initial state. Additionally, when dealing with objects or arrays, make sure to handle immutability properly to avoid unexpected behavior.
