`useReducer` is a Hook in React that is commonly used for managing more complex state logic in functional components. It is often preferred over `useState` when state transitions depend on the previous state or when the state logic is complex and involves multiple sub-values.

Here is an example of how to use `useReducer` in a functional React component along with an explanation:

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

// Reducer function
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case 'RESET':
      return { count: 0 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Component using useReducer
const Counter = () => {
  // useReducer returns the current state and a dispatch function
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  // Event handlers dispatch actions to update state
  const increment = () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  const decrement = () => dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
  const reset = () => dispatch({ type: 'RESET' });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

Explanation:

1. **Reducer Function:**
   - `reducer` is a function that takes the current state and an action as parameters and returns the new state.
   - It typically uses a `switch` statement to handle different action types and update the state accordingly.

2. **useReducer Hook:**
   - `useReducer` is called with the reducer function and an initial state.
   - It returns an array with the current state and a dispatch function. The dispatch function is used to send actions to the reducer.

3. **Dispatching Actions:**
   - Event handlers (`increment`, `decrement`, `reset`) call the `dispatch` function with an action object.
   - The action object has a `type` property that corresponds to a specific case in the reducer.

4. **Updating State:**
   - The reducer function updates the state based on the action type.
   - In this example, 'INCREMENT' increases the count, 'DECREMENT' decreases the count, and 'RESET' sets the count to 0.

5. **Rendering:**
   - The component renders the current state (`state.count`) and buttons that trigger the corresponding actions.

Using `useReducer` can be especially beneficial when dealing with complex state logic or when multiple actions need to be handled in a single state update. It promotes a more predictable and manageable state management pattern in React functional components.
