In React, rendering HTML is a fundamental part of building user interfaces. React uses a syntax called JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe what the UI should look like. JSX looks similar to HTML but is actually a syntax extension for JavaScript. Here's how you can render HTML in React with an explanation:

1. **Import React:**
   Begin by importing the `React` library. This is necessary for using JSX.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   ```

2. **Create a Functional Component:**
   React components can be either class-based or functional. Here, we'll use a functional component.

   ```jsx
   const MyComponent = () => {
     // Component logic and HTML rendering will go here
   };
   ```

3. **Return JSX:**
   Inside the functional component, use the `return` statement to return JSX. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript.

   ```jsx
   const MyComponent = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

4. **Embed JavaScript Expressions:**
   You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces `{}`. This allows you to dynamically generate content.

   ```jsx
   const MyComponent = () => {
     const name = 'John';
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

5. **Render the Component:**
   To render your component, include it in another component or the `ReactDOM.render` method.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

   const MyComponent = () => {
     const name = 'John';
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
       </div>
     );
   };

   ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));
   ```

   In the example above, `ReactDOM.render` is used to render the `MyComponent` into an HTML element with the ID of 'root'. Make sure you have an HTML element with the ID 'root' in your HTML file where you want the React app to be mounted.

That's a basic overview of how you can render HTML in React using JSX. JSX makes it easy to describe the structure of your UI in a syntax that closely resembles HTML.
