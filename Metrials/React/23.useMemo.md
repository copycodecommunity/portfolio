In React, the `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of a computation. It is particularly useful when you have a computation that is expensive in terms of CPU or memory, and you want to avoid re-computing the result unless the dependencies of that computation change.

Here's how you can use `useMemo` in a functional React component:

```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ data, filter }) => {
  // useMemo takes a function and an array of dependencies
  const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
    // Expensive computation or filtering logic
    console.log('Computing filtered data...');

    // Simulating some filtering logic
    return data.filter(item => item.includes(filter));
  }, [data, filter]); // Dependencies that trigger re-computation

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Filtered Data:</h2>
      <ul>
        {filteredData.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Explanation:

1. **Import `useMemo`:**
   Make sure to import `useMemo` from the 'react' library.

   ```jsx
   import React, { useMemo } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Use `useMemo` in Component:**
   Wrap the expensive computation or logic inside the `useMemo` function. This function will only recompute its result when the dependencies (specified in the second argument) change.

   ```jsx
   const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
     // Expensive computation or filtering logic
     console.log('Computing filtered data...');

     // Simulating some filtering logic
     return data.filter(item => item.includes(filter));
   }, [data, filter]); // Dependencies that trigger re-computation
   ```

   In this example, `filteredData` will be memoized, and the filtering logic will only be recomputed if `data` or `filter` changes.

3. **Render the Result:**
   Use the memoized result in your component as needed.

   ```jsx
   return (
     <div>
       <h2>Filtered Data:</h2>
       <ul>
         {filteredData.map((item, index) => (
           <li key={index}>{item}</li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     </div>
   );
   ```

By using `useMemo`, you optimize your component by preventing unnecessary re-computations, which can improve performance in certain scenarios. It's important to note that `useMemo` is not always needed, and it's crucial to profile and measure the performance impact before and after applying memoization.
