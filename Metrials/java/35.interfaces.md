In Java, an interface is a blueprint for a class, defining a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. It allows for the creation of code that specifies what a class should do without providing the implementation details. Here's an explanation of interface classes in Java:

### Syntax:

```java
interface MyInterface {
    // Abstract methods (methods without body)
    void method1();

    // Abstract method with parameters
    void method2(int x, String y);

    // Another abstract method
    String method3();
}

// Implementing the interface in a class
class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    // Implementation of method1
    public void method1() {
        // Code for method1
    }

    // Implementation of method2
    public void method2(int x, String y) {
        // Code for method2
    }

    // Implementation of method3
    public String method3() {
        // Code for method3
        return "Hello";
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`interface` Keyword:**
   - The `interface` keyword is used to declare an interface in Java.

2. **Abstract Methods:**
   - Interface contains abstract methods, which are methods without a body (no implementation). These methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.

3. **Implementing an Interface:**
   - A class can implement one or more interfaces using the `implements` keyword.
   - All abstract methods defined in the interface must be implemented by the class.

4. **Method Implementation:**
   - In the implementing class, each abstract method in the interface must be provided with an actual implementation.

5. **Access Modifiers:**
   - The access modifier for methods in an interface is by default `public`. In the implementing class, the access modifier should be `public` as well.

6. **Multiple Inheritance:**
   - Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

7. **Default Methods (Java 8 and later):**
   - Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have default methods (methods with a body) and static methods.
   - Default methods allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

   ```java
   interface MyInterface {
       default void defaultMethod() {
           // Default method implementation
       }
   }
   ```

8. **Static Methods (Java 8 and later):**
   - Interfaces can also have static methods, which are methods associated with the interface itself, not with instances of the interface.

   ```java
   interface MyInterface {
       static void staticMethod() {
           // Static method implementation
       }
   }
   ```

9. **Constants (Java 9 and later):**
   - Starting from Java 9, interfaces can have private methods and private static methods.
   - Interfaces can also have private constants (fields) using the `private` modifier.

   ```java
   interface MyInterface {
       private static final int MY_CONSTANT = 42;
   }
   ```

In summary, interfaces in Java provide a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance. They allow you to define a contract for classes without specifying the implementation details, promoting a clean separation of concerns in your code.
