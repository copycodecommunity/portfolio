In Java, an inner class is a class that is defined within another class. Inner classes have several types and provide various benefits, including encapsulation, code organization, and access to members of the outer class. Here are the main types of inner classes in Java:

1. **Non-static (Inner) Class:**
   - Also known as a member inner class.
   - Defined inside another class without using the `static` keyword.
   - Has access to the members of the outer class, including private members.
   - Can be instantiated only within the outer class.

   ```java
   public class OuterClass {
       private int outerField;

       // Non-static inner class
       public class InnerClass {
           private int innerField;

           public void accessOuterField() {
               // Inner class can access outer class members
               outerField = 10;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Static Nested Class:**
   - Similar to a non-static inner class, but declared with the `static` keyword.
   - Doesn't have access to the instance members of the outer class.
   - Can be instantiated outside the outer class without creating an instance of the outer class.

   ```java
   public class OuterClass {
       private static int outerField;

       // Static nested class
       public static class NestedClass {
           private int nestedField;

           public void accessOuterField() {
               // Cannot access instance members of the outer class
               // outerField = 10; // Error
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Local Inner Class:**
   - Defined within a block of code, typically inside a method.
   - Has access to the members of the enclosing class and local variables if they are `final` or effectively `final`.
   - Scope is limited to the block in which it is defined.

   ```java
   public class OuterClass {
       private int outerField;

       public void outerMethod() {
           // Local inner class
           class LocalInnerClass {
               private int innerField;

               public void accessOuterField() {
                   // Can access outer class members
                   outerField = 10;
               }
           }

           LocalInnerClass localInner = new LocalInnerClass();
           localInner.accessOuterField();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Anonymous Inner Class:**
   - A class without a name defined at the point of instantiation.
   - Often used for implementing interfaces or extending classes without creating a separate class.
   - Can be instantiated only once.

   ```java
   interface MyInterface {
       void myMethod();
   }

   public class OuterClass {
       public void createAnonymousClass() {
           MyInterface anonymousClass = new MyInterface() {
               @Override
               public void myMethod() {
                   System.out.println("Anonymous class implementation");
               }
           };

           anonymousClass.myMethod();
       }
   }
   ```

Inner classes provide a way to logically group classes and interfaces in Java, enhancing encapsulation and code organization. The choice of using inner classes depends on the specific requirements of the program and design considerations.
