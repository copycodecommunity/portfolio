In Java, scope refers to the region of the program where a variable is defined and can be accessed. Java supports several types of scopes, including class-level scope, method-level scope, block-level scope, and local scope. Let's discuss each of these scopes in detail:

1. **Class-level Scope:**
   - Variables declared at the class level, outside of any method or block, have class-level scope.
   - These variables are often referred to as instance variables because they are associated with instances (objects) of the class.
   - They exist for the entire duration of an object's life and are initialized when an object is created.
   - Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`, or default) can be used to control the visibility of class-level variables.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       // Class-level scope
       private int classVariable;

       public void someMethod() {
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Method-level Scope:**
   - Parameters and local variables declared within a method have method-level scope.
   - They are only accessible within that specific method.
   - Once the method completes execution, these variables go out of scope and are eligible for garbage collection.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       public void myMethod(int parameter) {
           // Method-level scope
           int localVariable = 10;
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Block-level Scope:**
   - Variables declared within a pair of curly braces `{}` (block) have block-level scope.
   - These variables are only accessible within that block.
   - If a variable is declared inside a loop, `if` statement, or any other block, it is limited to that specific block.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       public void myMethod() {
           // Block-level scope
           if (someCondition) {
               int blockVariable = 20;
               // ...
           }
           // blockVariable is not accessible here
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Local Scope:**
   - Local variables are declared within a block and have the most limited scope.
   - They are only accessible within the immediate code block where they are declared.
   - Local variables are typically used for temporary storage and calculations.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       public void myMethod() {
           // Local scope
           int localVar = 30;
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Static Variables:**
   - Variables declared as `static` have a scope associated with the class rather than an instance of the class.
   - They exist for the entire duration of the program and are shared among all instances of the class.
   - `static` variables are often referred to as class variables.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       // Static variable (class-level scope)
       static int staticVar = 50;

       public void myMethod() {
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```

Understanding and appropriately managing variable scopes are essential for writing efficient and maintainable Java code. It helps prevent naming conflicts, controls access to variables, and ensures that resources are used efficiently.
