Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of a class to take on multiple forms. There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism (also known as method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (also known as method overriding).

1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):**
   - Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods having the same name, but with different parameters.
   - The compiler determines which method to call based on the number and types of parameters in the method call.
   - Overloaded methods must have a different number or type of parameters.

   ```java
   public class Calculator {
       // Method with two integer parameters
       public int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       // Method with three integer parameters
       public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
           return a + b + c;
       }

       // Method with two double parameters
       public double add(double a, double b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }
   ```

   In the example above, the `add` method is overloaded with different parameter types and counts.

2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):**
   - Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
   - It allows a subclass to provide a specialized implementation of a method defined in its superclass.
   - The overridden method in the subclass must have the same signature (name, return type, and parameters) as the method in the superclass.

   ```java
   // Superclass
   public class Animal {
       public void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   // Subclass
   public class Dog extends Animal {
       // Overriding the sound method
       public void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the `sound` method defined in the `Animal` class.

   ```java
   Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
   myAnimal.sound(); // Calls the overridden sound method in Dog class
   ```

   At runtime, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) determines the actual type of the object and calls the appropriate overridden method.

Polymorphism in Java enhances code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability by allowing methods to be called based on the context at either compile-time (method overloading) or runtime (method overriding).
