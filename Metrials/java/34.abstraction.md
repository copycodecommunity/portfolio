In Java, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is typically used as a base class for other classes. It serves as a blueprint for other classes, providing common characteristics and behaviors. Here are key features and explanations of abstract classes in Java:

1. **Declaration:**
   - Abstract classes are declared using the `abstract` keyword.
   - An abstract class can have abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with a body).

   ```java
   abstract class Shape {
       // abstract method
       abstract void draw();

       // concrete method
       void display() {
           System.out.println("Displaying shape");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Abstract Methods:**
   - Abstract methods are declared in an abstract class but do not have a method body.
   - Subclasses extending the abstract class must provide implementations for all abstract methods.

   ```java
   abstract class Shape {
       abstract void draw();
   }

   class Circle extends Shape {
       // implementation of abstract method
       void draw() {
           System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Constructor:**
   - Abstract classes can have constructors, and they are called when a subclass object is instantiated.
   - The constructor of the abstract class is responsible for initializing the common attributes.

   ```java
   abstract class Shape {
       int x, y;

       Shape(int x, int y) {
           this.x = x;
           this.y = y;
       }

       abstract void draw();
   }
   ```

4. **Access Modifiers:**
   - Abstract classes can have access modifiers (public, private, protected) for methods and attributes, controlling their visibility in subclasses.

   ```java
   abstract class Shape {
       // protected attribute
       protected int x, y;

       // public method
       public void setPosition(int x, int y) {
           this.x = x;
           this.y = y;
       }

       abstract void draw();
   }
   ```

5. **Extending Abstract Class:**
   - Subclasses extend the abstract class using the `extends` keyword.
   - Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for all abstract methods unless they are also declared as abstract.

   ```java
   class Circle extends Shape {
       int radius;

       Circle(int x, int y, int radius) {
           super(x, y);
           this.radius = radius;
       }

       void draw() {
           System.out.println("Drawing a circle at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with radius " + radius);
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Multiple Inheritance:**
   - Java supports single inheritance, meaning a class can extend only one abstract or concrete class.
   - Abstract classes can implement interfaces, providing a form of multiple inheritance.

   ```java
   interface Drawable {
       void draw();
   }

   abstract class Shape implements Drawable {
       // common attributes and methods
   }

   class Circle extends Shape {
       // implementation of draw() from the interface
       public void draw() {
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```

Abstract classes in Java provide a way to share common functionality among related classes while allowing for variations in behavior through method overriding. They are a key component of Java's object-oriented programming paradigm.
