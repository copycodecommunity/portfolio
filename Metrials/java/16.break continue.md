In Java, `break` and `continue` are control flow statements used within loops to alter their normal execution. Here's an explanation of each:

1. **`break` Statement:**
   - The `break` statement is used to terminate the loop prematurely.
   - When encountered, the `break` statement immediately exits the loop in which it appears, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.
   - It is often used when a certain condition is met, and you want to exit the loop early.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i == 5) {
           System.out.println("Breaking the loop at i = " + i);
           break;
       }
       System.out.println(i);
   }
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   0
   1
   2
   3
   4
   Breaking the loop at i = 5
   ```

2. **`continue` Statement:**
   - The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and jump to the next iteration.
   - It is often used when a certain condition is met, and you want to skip the remaining code for that specific iteration.

   **Example:**
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       if (i == 2) {
           System.out.println("Skipping iteration at i = " + i);
           continue;
       }
       System.out.println(i);
   }
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   0
   1
   Skipping iteration at i = 2
   3
   4
   ```

   In this example, when `i` is equal to 2, the `continue` statement is encountered, and the remaining code for that iteration is skipped. The loop proceeds to the next iteration.

Both `break` and `continue` can be used with various loop types, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. Their careful use can enhance the control flow and readability of your code within loops.
