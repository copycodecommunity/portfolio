In Java, user input is typically handled using the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package. Here's an explanation of how user input works in Java:

1. **Import the Scanner Class:**
   First, you need to import the `Scanner` class at the beginning of your Java program.

   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;
   ```

2. **Create a Scanner Object:**
   Next, you create a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. This object is associated with the standard input stream (`System.in`).

   ```java
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
   ```

3. **Reading Different Data Types:**
   The `Scanner` class provides methods to read different types of input data:

   - **Reading Integers:**
     ```java
     System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
     int myInt = scanner.nextInt();
     ```

   - **Reading Floating-Point Numbers:**
     ```java
     System.out.print("Enter a floating-point number: ");
     double myDouble = scanner.nextDouble();
     ```

   - **Reading Strings:**
     ```java
     System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
     String myString = scanner.next();
     ```

     Note that `next()` reads a single word. If you want to read an entire line, you can use `nextLine()`.

   - **Reading Characters:**
     ```java
     System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
     char myChar = scanner.next().charAt(0);
     ```

   - **Reading Booleans:**
     ```java
     System.out.print("Enter a boolean (true/false): ");
     boolean myBoolean = scanner.nextBoolean();
     ```

4. **Input Validation:**
   It's crucial to handle potential errors when taking user input. You can use methods like `hasNextInt()`, `hasNextDouble()`, etc., to check if the input is of the expected type.

   ```java
   System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
   if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
       int myInt = scanner.nextInt();
       // Continue processing with myInt
   } else {
       System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.");
   }
   ```

5. **Closing the Scanner:**
   It's good practice to close the `Scanner` object when you're done using it to release resources.

   ```java
   scanner.close();
   ```

   However, note that closing `System.in` (the standard input stream) may have unintended consequences, so it's often skipped in practice.

Here's a simple example that combines these concepts:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 2: Create a Scanner object
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 3: Reading input
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        // Step 4: Displaying the input
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old.");

        // Step 5: Closing the Scanner (optional)
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

This program prompts the user to enter their name and age, reads the input, and then displays a personalized message.
