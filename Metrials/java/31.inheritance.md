Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class. In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword. Here's an explanation of inheritance in Java:

### Base Class (Superclass):

A base class, also known as a superclass, is the class whose properties and behaviors are inherited by another class. It serves as the foundation for derived classes.

```java
// Base class
class Animal {
    String name;

    // Constructor
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Method
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}
```

### Derived Class (Subclass):

A derived class, also known as a subclass, is the class that inherits from another class. It can extend the functionality of the base class by adding new properties and methods or by overriding existing methods.

```java
// Derived class
class Dog extends Animal {
    String breed;

    // Constructor
    public Dog(String name, String breed) {
        // Call the constructor of the base class
        super(name);
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    // New method in the subclass
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking.");
    }

    // Overriding a method from the base class
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " (a dog of breed " + breed + ") is eating.");
    }
}
```

### Using Inheritance:

You can create objects of the derived class and access both the inherited and new properties and methods.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of the derived class
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Labrador");

        // Access properties and methods from the base class
        System.out.println("Name: " + myDog.name);
        myDog.eat(); // Calls overridden eat method in Dog class

        // Access properties and methods from the derived class
        System.out.println("Breed: " + myDog.breed);
        myDog.bark();
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

- **`extends` Keyword:** In Java, the `extends` keyword is used to establish inheritance. A class can extend only one class (single inheritance).
  
- **Constructor of the Base Class:** When creating an object of the derived class, the constructor of the base class is automatically called using `super()`.

- **Overriding Methods:** The derived class can override methods of the base class to provide its own implementation. The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is intended to override a method in the superclass.

- **Access Modifiers:** Inherited members can have different access modifiers in the derived class (e.g., `public`, `protected`, `private`). The choice affects the visibility of members in subclasses.

Inheritance promotes code reuse, enhances modularity, and allows for the creation of a hierarchical structure in your code.
