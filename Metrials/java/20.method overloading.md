Method overloading in Java allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. The parameters can differ in terms of the number, type, or order. Method overloading is a form of polymorphism and contributes to the readability and maintainability of code. Here's an explanation of method overloading in Java:

### 1. **Method Signature:**
   - Method overloading is determined by the method signature, which includes the method name and the type, order, and number of its parameters.
   - Return type alone is not considered for method overloading; two methods with the same name and parameter types but different return types will result in a compilation error.

### 2. **Different Parameter Types:**
   - Overloaded methods can have different types of parameters.
   
   ```java
   public class Calculator {
       public int add(int num1, int num2) {
           return num1 + num2;
       }
   
       public double add(double num1, double num2) {
           return num1 + num2;
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `add` method is overloaded with different parameter types (integers and doubles).

### 3. **Different Number of Parameters:**
   - Overloaded methods can have a different number of parameters.
   
   ```java
   public class Printer {
       public void print(String message) {
           System.out.println(message);
       }
   
       public void print(String message, int copies) {
           for (int i = 0; i < copies; i++) {
               System.out.println(message);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Here, the `print` method is overloaded with different numbers of parameters.

### 4. **Different Parameter Order:**
   - The order of parameters also contributes to method overloading.
   
   ```java
   public class Rectangle {
       public double calculateArea(double length, double width) {
           return length * width;
       }
   
       public double calculateArea(double width, double length, double height) {
           return width * length * height;
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `calculateArea` method is overloaded with different parameter orders.

### 5. **Same Method Name:**
   - The overloaded methods must have the same name but can have different implementations based on the parameters.

### 6. **Compile-Time Polymorphism:**
   - Method overloading is an example of compile-time polymorphism or static polymorphism.
   - The compiler determines which method to call based on the method signature during compilation.

### 7. **Example Usage:**
   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
           System.out.println(calculator.add(5, 7));          // Calls the first add method
           System.out.println(calculator.add(3.5, 2.5));      // Calls the second add method
   
           Printer printer = new Printer();
           printer.print("Hello");                            // Calls the first print method
           printer.print("Java", 3);                         // Calls the second print method
       }
   }
   ```

   In the `Main` class, you can see the usage of overloaded methods from the `Calculator` and `Printer` classes.

Method overloading in Java provides flexibility and improves code readability by allowing developers to use the same method name for logically related operations with different parameter sets.
