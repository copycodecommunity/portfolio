In Java, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes and behaviors (methods) common to all objects of that type. A method is a block of code associated with a class or an object that performs a specific task. Let's explore classes and methods in Java with explanations:

### 1. Class in Java:

A class in Java is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data (attributes) and methods (functions) to operate on that data. It provides a way to model real-world entities in a program.

#### Example of a Simple Class:

```java
// Defining a class named "Person"
public class Person {
    // Attributes (fields) of the class
    String name;
    int age;

    // Methods of the class
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class has two attributes (`name` and `age`) and a method (`displayInfo`) that prints the information.

### 2. Object in Java:

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and is created using the `new` keyword. Objects have state (values of attributes) and behavior (methods).

#### Example of Creating an Object:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Person class
        Person person1 = new Person();

        // Assigning values to attributes
        person1.name = "John";
        person1.age = 25;

        // Calling the method to display information
        person1.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

In this example, `person1` is an object of the `Person` class, and it is used to access the attributes and methods of the class.

### 3. Method in Java:

A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is defined within a class and can be called by objects of that class. Methods can have parameters (input) and may return a value.

#### Example of a Method with Parameters and Return Type:

```java
public class Calculator {
    // Method to add two numbers and return the result
    int add(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Calculator class
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        // Calling the add method and storing the result
        int result = calc.add(5, 7);

        // Printing the result
        System.out.println("Sum: " + result);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `add` method takes two parameters (`num1` and `num2`) and returns the sum of those numbers.

Classes and methods are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) and provide a way to organize and structure code. Classes define the blueprint, and objects are instances of that blueprint with their own state and behavior. Methods encapsulate functionality, promoting code reuse and modular design.
