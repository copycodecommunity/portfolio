Recursion in Java refers to the process in which a method calls itself. A method that calls itself is called a recursive method. Recursive methods are widely used in solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Here's an explanation of recursion in Java:

1. **Base Case:**
   - Every recursive method must have a base case, which is the condition under which the recursion stops.
   - Without a base case, the recursion would continue indefinitely, eventually leading to a stack overflow.
   - The base case provides a way for the recursion to reach a termination point.

   ```java
   public class RecursiveExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           int result = factorial(5);
           System.out.println("Factorial: " + result);
       }

       // Recursive method to calculate factorial
       static int factorial(int n) {
           // Base case
           if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
               return 1;
           }

           // Recursive case
           return n * factorial(n - 1);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - The recursive case defines how the problem is broken down into smaller sub-problems.
   - The method calls itself with a modified set of parameters to make progress towards the base case.
   - Each recursive call should ideally move closer to the base case.

3. **Example: Factorial Calculation:**
   - The example above calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
   - The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
   - The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the factorial is 1.
   - The recursive case multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n-1`, thus breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.

4. **Recursion Stack:**
   - When a method is called, a new frame is added to the call stack to store local variables and the return address.
   - In recursive methods, each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack.
   - The stack frames are popped off the stack as the base cases are reached, and the recursion starts unwinding.

5. **Advantages of Recursion:**
   - Simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
   - Can lead to elegant and concise solutions for certain types of problems.

6. **Drawbacks of Recursion:**
   - May have higher memory consumption due to the recursion stack.
   - Can lead to stack overflow if not implemented with a proper base case or for very deep recursion.

Recursion is a powerful technique, but it should be used judiciously. Understanding the base case and ensuring that the recursion converges towards the base case are crucial for implementing correct and efficient recursive solutions.
