**What are JavaScript Events?**

In JavaScript, events are things that happen to HTML elements on a web page. These could be interactions from the user or other changes in the environment.

**Common Types of Events:**

1. **Click Event:**
   - *What it is:* Occurs when a user clicks on an element.
   - *Example:* Clicking a button.

2. **Mouseover Event:**
   - *What it is:* Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
   - *Example:* Hovering over an image.

3. **Keydown Event:**
   - *What it is:* Fired when a key on the keyboard is pressed.
   - *Example:* Typing a letter into a text field.

4. **Submit Event:**
   - *What it is:* Happens when a form is submitted.
   - *Example:* Pressing the "Submit" button on a form.

5. **Load Event:**
   - *What it is:* Occurs when a page, or an element, finishes loading.
   - *Example:* Page completely loading with all images.

**How Events Work:**

1. **Event Triggering:**
   - Events are triggered by interactions or changes. For instance, clicking a button triggers a "click" event.

2. **Event Listening:**
   - JavaScript listens for these events on specific HTML elements.

3. **Event Handling:**
   - When an event occurs, a function (event handler) is executed to respond to that event.

**Basic Structure:**

```javascript
// Example: Adding a click event listener to a button
const myButton = document.getElementById('myButton');

myButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Code to execute when the button is clicked
    alert('Button Clicked!');
});
```

In this example, we're saying, "Hey JavaScript, when the element with the ID 'myButton' is clicked, execute this function."

**Preventing Default Behavior:**

Sometimes, when an event happens (like submitting a form), the browser does something by default (like reloading the page). You can prevent this default behavior using `event.preventDefault()`.

```javascript
const myForm = document.getElementById('myForm');

myForm.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    // Prevent the default form submission behavior
    event.preventDefault();
    
    // Custom code to handle the form submission
    console.log('Form Submitted!');
});
```

This ensures that your custom code runs instead of the default action.

Understanding events is fundamental to creating interactive and dynamic web pages. They allow your JavaScript code to respond to user actions and create a more engaging user experience.
