Type conversion in JavaScript refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variables can hold values of any data type, and the type of a variable can change during the execution of a program.

There are two main types of type conversion in JavaScript: **implicit (automatic) type conversion** and **explicit (manual) type conversion**.

### Implicit Type Conversion:

Implicit type conversion, also known as type coercion, occurs when JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another during an operation. This is done to make the values compatible for the operation. For example:

```javascript
let num = 5;          // num is a number
let str = "10";       // str is a string

let result = num + str;  // JavaScript converts num to a string for the operation
console.log(result);    // "510" (a string)
```

In the above example, the `+` operator is used for concatenating strings when one of the operands is a string. So, JavaScript converts the `num` variable to a string to perform the concatenation.

### Explicit Type Conversion:

Explicit type conversion, also known as type casting or coercion, occurs when a developer manually converts a value from one type to another. JavaScript provides several functions and methods for explicit type conversion:

1. **String Conversion:**
   ```javascript
   let num = 123;
   let str = String(num);  // explicit conversion to string
   ```

2. **Number Conversion:**
   ```javascript
   let str = "456";
   let num = Number(str);  // explicit conversion to number
   ```

3. **Boolean Conversion:**
   ```javascript
   let value = "Hello";
   let isTrue = Boolean(value);  // explicit conversion to boolean
   ```

4. **parseInt and parseFloat:**
   ```javascript
   let strNum = "123";
   let num = parseInt(strNum);   // converts string to integer
   let floatNum = parseFloat("3.14");  // converts string to floating-point number
   ```

### Truthy and Falsy Values:

JavaScript has truthy and falsy values, which can affect implicit type conversion. For example:

```javascript
let num = 0;        // falsy value
let str = "Hello";  // truthy value

if (num) {
  console.log("Truthy");  // This block will not be executed
}

if (str) {
  console.log("Truthy");  // This block will be executed
}
```

In the above example, the `if` statement implicitly converts the values to boolean, treating `num` as falsy and `str` as truthy.

Understanding type conversion is crucial for avoiding unexpected behaviors in your code and ensuring that operations are performed correctly with compatible data types.
