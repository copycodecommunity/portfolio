## JavaScript Tutorial Assignment

### Assignment Overview:

In this assignment, you will create a simple web page and write JavaScript code to implement various functionalities. This assignment is designed for beginners to get hands-on experience with basic JavaScript concepts.

### Task 1: Setting Up Your Web Page

1. Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and set up the basic structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. Link your HTML file to an external JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) using the `<script>` tag.

### Task 2: Displaying Output

3. Write JavaScript code to display a greeting message on the web page. Use `alert()`, `console.log()`, and modify the HTML content dynamically using `document.getElementById()`.

### Task 3: Variables and Data Types

4. Declare variables to store the following information:
   - Your name
   - Your age
   - Your favorite programming language

   Display these variables on the web page using appropriate JavaScript syntax.

### Task 4: User Input and Conditional Statements

5. Prompt the user to enter their age using `prompt()`. Use conditional statements (`if`, `else`) to check if the user is eligible to access a certain content on the page. For example, allow access only if the user is above 18 years old.

### Task 5: Functions

6. Write a function that takes two parameters (numbers) and returns their sum. Call the function and display the result on the web page.

### Task 6: Arrays and Loops

7. Create an array of your favorite colors. Use a loop to display each color on the web page. Experiment with different types of loops (e.g., `for`, `while`).

### Task 7: DOM Manipulation

8. Create a button on the web page. Write JavaScript code to change the background color of the page when the button is clicked. Use `addEventListener()` for handling the button click event.

### Task 8: Error Handling

9. Implement error handling using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`. For example, handle division by zero when dividing two numbers.

### Submission:

Submit your assignment by providing a link to your HTML and JavaScript files. Include comments in your JavaScript code to explain the purpose of each section.
