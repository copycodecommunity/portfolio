Below is a detailed comment explaining a basic JavaScript code snippet. The code demonstrates a simple function that checks whether a given number is even or odd. Each line of the code is accompanied by comments explaining its purpose.

```javascript
// This is a basic JavaScript function that determines whether a number is even or odd.

// Function definition:
function checkEvenOrOdd(number) {
    // The function takes a single parameter 'number', which represents the number to be checked.

    // Check if the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder (i.e., it's an even number):
    if (number % 2 === 0) {
        // If the condition is true, log a message to the console indicating that the number is even.
        console.log(`The number ${number} is even.`);
        // Return a string indicating that the number is even.
        return "even";
    } else {
        // If the number is not even, log a message indicating that it's odd.
        console.log(`The number ${number} is odd.`);
        // Return a string indicating that the number is odd.
        return "odd";
    }

    // Note: The 'return' statements are not strictly necessary in this case since the function also logs messages.
}

// Example usage:
const result = checkEvenOrOdd(7);
// In this example, the number 7 is passed to the function.

// The function will log a message to the console based on whether 7 is even or odd.
// The result variable will store the string returned by the function ("odd" in this case).

// End of code.
