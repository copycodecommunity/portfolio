In JavaScript, the `Math.random()` function is used to generate pseudo-random floating-point numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This means that it can return any value from 0 up to, but not including, 1. The numbers generated by `Math.random()` are considered pseudo-random because they are determined by an algorithm and not truly random.

Here's how you can use `Math.random()`:

```javascript
const randomNumber = Math.random();
console.log(randomNumber);
```

This will output a random decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). It could be something like `0.123456789`.

If you want to generate random integers within a specific range, you can use `Math.floor()` in combination with `Math.random()`. For example, if you want a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive), you can do:

```javascript
const randomInteger = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
console.log(randomInteger);
```

In this example, `Math.random() * 10` generates a floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive). `Math.floor()` rounds down to the nearest integer. Adding 1 ensures that the final result is between 1 and 10.

Keep in mind that the numbers generated by `Math.random()` are not truly random. They are generated by an algorithm, and if you know the seed value (which is not exposed in JavaScript), you could reproduce the sequence of "random" numbers. For cryptographic purposes, where true randomness is crucial, `crypto.getRandomValues()` should be used instead.

Here's a simple example of generating a random number within a custom range:

```javascript
function getRandomNumber(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

const randomInRange = getRandomNumber(5, 15);
console.log(randomInRange);
```

This `getRandomNumber` function takes a `min` and `max` value and returns a random integer within that range, inclusive.
