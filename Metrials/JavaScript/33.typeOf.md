In JavaScript, the `typeof` operator is used to determine the type of a given operand or expression. It returns a string indicating the data type of the operand. The syntax is:

```javascript
typeof operand
```

Here, `operand` is the expression or variable for which you want to determine the type.

The `typeof` operator can return the following string values:

1. **"undefined":** Indicates that the operand has not been assigned a value, or its value is `undefined`.

    ```javascript
    typeof undefinedVariable; // "undefined"
    ```

2. **"boolean":** Indicates that the operand is a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

    ```javascript
    typeof true; // "boolean"
    ```

3. **"number":** Indicates that the operand is a number, whether it's an integer, floating-point number, or `NaN` (Not-a-Number).

    ```javascript
    typeof 42; // "number"
    ```

4. **"string":** Indicates that the operand is a string.

    ```javascript
    typeof "Hello"; // "string"
    ```

5. **"bigint":** Indicates that the operand is a BigInt.

    ```javascript
    typeof BigInt(42); // "bigint"
    ```

6. **"symbol":** Indicates that the operand is a symbol.

    ```javascript
    typeof Symbol("example"); // "symbol"
    ```

7. **"function":** Indicates that the operand is a function.

    ```javascript
    typeof function() {}; // "function"
    ```

8. **"object":** Indicates that the operand is an object or `null`. Note that arrays and some other non-primitive types are considered objects.

    ```javascript
    typeof { key: "value" }; // "object"
    typeof null; // "object"
    ```

9. **"object":** (for arrays) - Arrays are special kinds of objects, but their type is identified as "object" by `typeof`. To specifically check if a variable is an array, you can use `Array.isArray()`.

    ```javascript
    Array.isArray([1, 2, 3]); // true
    typeof [1, 2, 3]; // "object"
    ```

It's important to note that `typeof` has some quirks and limitations. For example, it doesn't distinguish between different types of objects (except functions), and it returns "object" for arrays and `null`. In cases where more detailed type checking is needed, other methods, such as the `instanceof` operator or specific type-checking libraries, might be more appropriate.
