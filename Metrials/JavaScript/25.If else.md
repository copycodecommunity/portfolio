In JavaScript, the `if...else` statement is used for conditional execution of code. It allows you to specify a block of code that should be executed if a certain condition is `true`, and an alternative block of code to be executed if the condition is `false`. Here's the basic syntax:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

Let's break down the components:

1. **Condition:**
   - The `if` statement begins with the keyword `if`, followed by a set of parentheses `()`.
   - Inside the parentheses, you provide a condition. This condition is a Boolean expression, which is an expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.

2. **Code Block (if true):**
   - If the condition inside the parentheses is `true`, the code inside the curly braces `{}` immediately following the `if` statement is executed.
   - This block of code is often referred to as the "if block."

3. **`else` Clause:**
   - Optionally, you can include an `else` clause immediately after the closing curly brace of the `if` block.
   - The `else` block is executed if the condition in the `if` statement is `false`.
   - The `else` keyword is followed by another set of curly braces `{}` containing the code to be executed if the condition is `false`.

Here's an example to illustrate the `if...else` statement in action:

```javascript
let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```

In this example:
- The condition is `age >= 18`.
- If the `age` is greater than or equal to `18`, the code inside the `if` block is executed, and it logs "You are an adult."
- If the condition is `false`, the code inside the `else` block is executed, logging "You are a minor."

You can also use multiple `else if` clauses to check for additional conditions:

```javascript
let hour = 15;

if (hour < 12) {
  console.log("Good morning!");
} else if (hour < 18) {
  console.log("Good afternoon!");
} else {
  console.log("Good evening!");
}
```

In this example:
- If `hour` is less than 12, it logs "Good morning!"
- If `hour` is between 12 (inclusive) and 18 (exclusive), it logs "Good afternoon!"
- If none of the above conditions are met, it logs "Good evening!"
