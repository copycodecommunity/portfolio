JavaScript hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, even before the code is executed. This allows you to use variables and functions in your code before they are declared.

Let's break down the key aspects of hoisting:

1. **Variable Hoisting:**
   When a JavaScript file is executed, variable declarations (not initializations) are hoisted to the top of their containing scope. However, the initializations are not hoisted. This means you can use a variable before it's declared in the code.

   ```javascript
   console.log(x); // undefined (not an error)
   var x = 5;
   console.log(x); // 5
   ```

   In the above example, `var x` is hoisted to the top of its scope, but the assignment (`x = 5`) remains in its original position.

   It's important to note that `let` and `const` declarations are also hoisted, but they are not initialized with `undefined` as in the case of `var`. Instead, they enter a "temporal dead zone" and cannot be accessed until the actual declaration is reached in the code.

   ```javascript
   console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
   let y = 10;
   ```

2. **Function Hoisting:**
   Function declarations are also hoisted to the top of their scope, including the entire function body. This means you can call a function before it's declared in the code.

   ```javascript
   foo(); // "Hello, World!"

   function foo() {
       console.log("Hello, World!");
   }
   ```

   However, function expressions (anonymous functions assigned to variables) do not exhibit the same hoisting behavior:

   ```javascript
   bar(); // TypeError: bar is not a function

   var bar = function() {
       console.log("Hello, World!");
   };
   ```

   In this case, the variable declaration `var bar` is hoisted, but it is initialized with `undefined`. Therefore, trying to call `bar()` before the actual assignment results in an error.

3. **Order of Hoisting:**
   The order of hoisting is determined by the type of declaration. Functions are hoisted first, followed by variable declarations.

   ```javascript
   foo(); // "Hello from foo!"

   function foo() {
       console.log("Hello from foo!");
   }

   var x = 5;

   console.log(x); // 5
   ```

   In this example, the function `foo` is hoisted first, followed by the variable declaration `var x`.

Understanding hoisting is important for writing predictable and error-free JavaScript code. It's a good practice to declare your variables and functions at the beginning of their scope to avoid unexpected behaviors.
