JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a language-independent data format and is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, as well as to store configuration data.

Here are some key aspects of JSON:

1. **Data Format:**
   JSON is a text-based data format that uses a simple and easy-to-read syntax. It consists of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or `null`. JSON data is usually represented as a string.

2. **Basic Structure:**
   - **Object:** An unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Each key is a string, followed by a colon `:`, and its corresponding value.
     ```json
     {
       "name": "John",
       "age": 30,
       "isStudent": false
     }
     ```

   - **Array:** An ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
     ```json
     [1, 2, 3, "apple", true]
     ```

   - **Value Types:** Strings are enclosed in double quotes `""`. Numbers can be integers or floating-point. Booleans are either `true` or `false`, and `null` represents an empty value.
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Alice",
       "age": 25,
       "isStudent": true,
       "city": null
     }
     ```

3. **Nested Structures:**
   JSON supports nesting of objects and arrays, allowing you to create complex data structures.
   ```json
   {
     "person": {
       "name": "Bob",
       "age": 28,
       "address": {
         "city": "New York",
         "zipCode": "10001"
       }
     },
     "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling"]
   }
   ```

4. **Parsing and Serialization:**
   - **Parsing:** Converting a JSON string into a JavaScript object is called parsing. You can use the `JSON.parse()` method for this.
     ```javascript
     const jsonString = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}';
     const person = JSON.parse(jsonString);
     ```

   - **Serialization:** Converting a JavaScript object into a JSON string is called serialization. You can use the `JSON.stringify()` method.
     ```javascript
     const person = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };
     const jsonString = JSON.stringify(person);
     ```

5. **Use Cases:**
   - **Data Exchange:** JSON is widely used for data exchange between a server and a web application. APIs often return data in JSON format.
   - **Configuration Files:** JSON is commonly used for configuration files due to its simplicity and readability.
   - **Storage:** JSON is used to store structured data in databases.

6. **Limitations:**
   - **No Comments:** JSON does not support comments.
   - **No Functions:** JSON is a data format and does not support executable code.
   - **No Circular References:** JSON does not handle circular references well.

Overall, JSON provides a lightweight and human-readable way to represent structured data, making it a popular choice in web development and data exchange scenarios.
