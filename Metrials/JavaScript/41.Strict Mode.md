JavaScript strict mode is a feature that was introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5) to enhance the language by catching common coding errors and preventing the usage of certain "unsafe" features. When you enable strict mode, the JavaScript interpreter becomes more strict and unforgiving regarding potential issues in your code. To enable strict mode, you simply add the following line at the beginning of a script or a function:

```javascript
"use strict";
```

Here are some key aspects of JavaScript strict mode:

1. **Error Handling:**
   - In strict mode, silent errors or actions that would otherwise fail silently will throw errors. For example, assigning values to read-only properties, assignments to undeclared variables, and attempts to delete variables or functions will result in errors.

2. **Variable Declaration:**
   - Variables must be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const` before they are used. Assigning values to variables without declaring them first will result in an error.

     ```javascript
     // Without strict mode (non-strict mode)
     undeclaredVar = 10; // No error

     // With strict mode
     "use strict";
     undeclaredVar = 10; // Throws an error: ReferenceError: undeclaredVar is not defined
     ```

3. **Assignment to Read-Only Properties:**
   - In strict mode, assignments to read-only properties or variables will result in an error.

     ```javascript
     // Without strict mode (non-strict mode)
     var obj = {};
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", { value: 42, writable: false });
     obj.x = 10; // No error

     // With strict mode
     "use strict";
     var obj = {};
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", { value: 42, writable: false });
     obj.x = 10; // Throws an error: TypeError: Cannot assign to read-only property 'x' of object '#<Object>'
     ```

4. **Octal Literals:**
   - Octal literals (e.g., `0123`) are not allowed in strict mode.

     ```javascript
     // Without strict mode (non-strict mode)
     var octalNumber = 0123; // No error

     // With strict mode
     "use strict";
     var octalNumber = 0123; // Throws an error: SyntaxError: Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode.
     ```

5. **With Statement:**
   - The use of the `with` statement is not allowed in strict mode. The `with` statement is generally considered harmful and has been deprecated.

     ```javascript
     // Without strict mode (non-strict mode)
     var obj = { x: 42 };
     with (obj) {
       console.log(x); // 42
     }

     // With strict mode
     "use strict";
     var obj = { x: 42 };
     with (obj) {
       console.log(x); // Throws an error: SyntaxError: Strict mode code may not include a with statement
     }
     ```

6. **`eval` and `arguments`:**
   - In strict mode, the `eval` function and the `arguments` object have their own scope, and they cannot affect variables outside their scope.

     ```javascript
     // Without strict mode (non-strict mode)
     var x = 10;
     eval("var x = 20;");
     console.log(x); // 20

     // With strict mode
     "use strict";
     var x = 10;
     eval("var x = 20;");
     console.log(x); // 10
     ```

7. **`this` in Functions:**
   - In strict mode, the value of `this` inside a function that is not a method or a constructor is `undefined` rather than the global object.

     ```javascript
     // Without strict mode (non-strict mode)
     function nonStrictModeFunction() {
       console.log(this); // [object Window]
     }
     nonStrictModeFunction();

     // With strict mode
     "use strict";
     function strictModeFunction() {
       console.log(this); // undefined
     }
     strictModeFunction();
     ```

8. **Deletion of Variables:**
   - Deleting variables (e.g., using the `delete` operator) is not allowed in strict mode.

     ```javascript
     // Without strict mode (non-strict mode)
     var nonStrictVar = 10;
     delete nonStrictVar; // No error

     // With strict mode
     "use strict";
     var strictVar = 10;
     delete strictVar; // Throws an error: SyntaxError: Delete of an unqualified identifier in strict mode.
     ```

Strict mode helps developers catch common mistakes early and promotes writing cleaner, more maintainable code. It is recommended to use strict mode in all modern JavaScript projects.
