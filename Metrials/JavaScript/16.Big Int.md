In JavaScript, `BigInt` is a data type that allows you to work with integers of arbitrary precision. Traditional JavaScript numbers are represented as 64-bit floating-point values, which means they have limitations on the size of integers they can accurately represent. `BigInt` is introduced to overcome this limitation.

Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Regular Numbers (`Number`):**
   - Limited Precision: JavaScript uses a 64-bit floating-point representation for regular numbers.
   - Limited Range: Numbers can accurately represent integers up to 2^53 - 1 and fractions with limited precision.

```javascript
let regularNumber = 9007199254740991; // Max safe integer in JavaScript

console.log(regularNumber); // 9007199254740991
console.log(regularNumber + 1); // 9007199254740992 (accurate)
console.log(regularNumber + 2); // 9007199254740992 (inaccurate, precision loss)
```

2. **BigInt:**
   - Arbitrary Precision: `BigInt` can represent integers with arbitrary precision.
   - Created by appending `n` to an integer literal or by calling the `BigInt()` constructor.

```javascript
let bigIntNumber = 9007199254740991n; // Note the 'n' at the end

console.log(bigIntNumber); // 9007199254740991
console.log(bigIntNumber + 1n); // 9007199254740992n (no precision loss)
console.log(bigIntNumber + 2n); // 9007199254740993n (no precision loss)
```

With `BigInt`, you can perform operations on very large integers without worrying about precision loss. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you need to work with extremely large numbers, such as cryptographic operations, mathematical computations, or handling large data sets.

Keep in mind that `BigInt` and regular numbers are distinct types, and you need to use `BigInt` explicitly when you want to work with integers beyond the safe integer limit.
