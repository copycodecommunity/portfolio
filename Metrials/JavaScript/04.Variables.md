Let's delve into JavaScript variables in detail.

### JavaScript Variables:

Variables in JavaScript are containers that store values. You can think of them as named storage locations for data. Variables are fundamental to programming as they allow you to manipulate and store information dynamically during the execution of a program.

### Declaration:

In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword.

- **`var`:** The old way of declaring variables. It has function scope, meaning it's scoped to the nearest function, and it is hoisted.

    ```javascript
    var x = 10;
    ```

- **`let`:** Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). It has block scope and is also hoisted.

    ```javascript
    let y = 20;
    ```

- **`const`:** Also introduced in ES6. It is used to declare constants with block scope. Once assigned, the value cannot be reassigned.

    ```javascript
    const PI = 3.14;
    ```

### Naming Conventions:

- Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different).

### Assigning Values:

You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (`=`).

```javascript
let message = "Hello, JavaScript!";
```

### Data Types:

JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any data type. The basic data types include:

- **Primitive Types:**
    - `Number`: Numeric values (e.g., 42, 3.14).
    - `String`: Textual data (e.g., "Hello").
    - `Boolean`: True or false.
    - `Undefined`: Represents an uninitialized variable.
    - `Null`: Represents the absence of any object value.
    - `Symbol`: A unique and immutable value.

- **Object Types:**
    - `Object`: A collection of key-value pairs.
    - `Array`: An ordered list of values.
    - `Function`: A reusable block of code.

### Scope:

- **Global Scope:** Variables declared outside a function or a block have global scope.
- **Function Scope:** Variables declared inside a function have function scope.
- **Block Scope:** Introduced with `let` and `const`, variables declared inside a block (e.g., within an `if` statement or a loop) have block scope.

### Hoisting:

JavaScript hoists variable declarations. This means that variables are moved to the top of their scope during compilation.

```javascript
console.log(z); // Outputs: undefined
var z = 30;
console.log(z); // Outputs: 30
```

### Example:

```javascript
// Variable Declaration
let age;

// Variable Assignment
age = 25;

// Using Variables
let message = `I am ${age} years old.`;

// Output
console.log(message); // Outputs: I am 25 years old.
```

Understanding variables is crucial for writing effective and flexible JavaScript code. They form the foundation for manipulating data and creating dynamic programs.
