Let's break down JavaScript functions in simple terms:

### What is a Function?
In JavaScript, a function is like a recipe or a set of instructions. It's a way to group code together and give it a name, so you can use it whenever you need to perform a specific task.

### Defining a Function:
To create a function, you use the `function` keyword followed by a name and a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you can list parameters (inputs) the function needs.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

Here, `greet` is the function name, and it takes a parameter called `name`.

### Calling a Function:
Once a function is defined, you can use it by calling (or invoking) it. You do this by using the function name followed by parentheses. If the function expects parameters, you provide them inside the parentheses.

```javascript
greet("John");
```

This will print "Hello, John!" to the console.

### Return Statement:
Functions can also return a value using the `return` keyword. This is like the result or output of the function.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = add(3, 5);
console.log(result); // Outputs 8
```

The `add` function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

### Function Expression:
You can also create a function using a variable. This is called a function expression.

```javascript
let multiply = function(x, y) {
  return x * y;
};

let product = multiply(4, 6);
console.log(product); // Outputs 24
```

Here, `multiply` is a variable that holds a function.

### Arrow Function:
In modern JavaScript, arrow functions provide a more concise way to write functions.

```javascript
let square = (num) => {
  return num * num;
};

let result = square(4);
console.log(result); // Outputs 16
```

### Scope:
Functions can have their own variables, and the variables inside a function are not visible or accessible outside the function. This is called scope.

```javascript
function example() {
  let localVar = "I'm local!";
  console.log(localVar);
}

example(); // Outputs "I'm local!"

// This will result in an error because localVar is not defined here
console.log(localVar);
```

### Callbacks:
Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. When a function is passed as an argument to another function and is executed inside that function, it's called a callback.

```javascript
function doSomething(callback) {
  console.log("Doing something...");
  callback();
}

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

doSomething(greet); // Outputs "Doing something..." followed by "Hello!"
```

These are some fundamental aspects of JavaScript functions. They allow you to organize and reuse code, making your programs more modular and easier to understand.
