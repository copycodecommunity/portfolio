The `switch` statement in JavaScript is a control flow statement that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression. It's a cleaner and more readable alternative to using multiple `if...else` statements when you need to compare a single value against multiple possible values.

Here's the basic syntax of the `switch` statement:

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression === value1
    break;

  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression === value2
    break;

  // More cases...

  default:
    // code to be executed if none of the cases match
}
```

Let's break down each part:

- `switch (expression)`: This is the initial part of the `switch` statement. It contains the expression whose value will be compared against the various `case` values.

- `case value1:`: This is a specific case to be checked against the expression. If `expression` is equal to `value1`, the code inside this case will be executed.

- `break;`: The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` statement. Without it, the code would continue to execute the next cases even if the current case is true. Each `case` block should end with a `break;` statement.

- `default:`: This is an optional part of the `switch` statement. If none of the `case` values match the expression, the code inside the `default` block will be executed. It's similar to the `else` block in an `if...else` statement.

Here's an example:

```javascript
let day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("It's the start of the week!");
    break;

  case "Wednesday":
    console.log("Halfway through the week!");
    break;

  case "Friday":
    console.log("It's Friday! Time to party!");
    break;

  default:
    console.log("It's not a special day.");
}
```

In this example, the `switch` statement compares the value of `day` against different cases. If `day` matches any of the specified days, the corresponding code block is executed. If no match is found, the `default` block is executed.

One important thing to note is that JavaScript uses strict comparison (`===`), so the expression is checked for both value and type. If you omit the `break` statement, the control will fall through to the next case, which is a behavior you might use intentionally in some cases, but it's generally advisable to use `break` to prevent unintended fall-through.
