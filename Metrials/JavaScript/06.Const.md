Let's dive into the `const` keyword in JavaScript.

### `const` in JavaScript

In JavaScript, `const` is used to declare variables, but with a key characteristic: once a variable is assigned with `const`, its value cannot be changed or reassigned.

#### Declaration:

```javascript
const pi = 3.14;
```

In this example, we declare a constant variable named `pi` and assign it the value `3.14`.

#### Key Points:

1. **Immutable Value:**
   - The value assigned to a `const` variable cannot be changed.

   ```javascript
   // This will result in an error
   pi = 3.14159; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable
   ```

2. **Block Scope:**
   - Like `let`, `const` has block scope, meaning it is only accessible within the block (portion of code) where it is defined.

   ```javascript
   if (true) {
     const blockScoped = "I'm only available in this block";
   }
   ```

3. **Declaration and Initialization:**
   - A `const` variable must be initialized during declaration. You cannot declare it without providing an initial value.

   ```javascript
   // This will result in an error
   const temperature; // Error: Missing initializer in const declaration
   ```

4. **Use Cases:**
   - `const` is often used for values that should remain constant throughout the program, like mathematical constants or configuration values.

   ```javascript
   const maxAttempts = 3;
   ```

#### When to Use `const`:

- Use `const` when you have a value that should not be changed throughout the program.
- It makes your code more readable by signaling that a variable is meant to be constant.
- Use it for variables that represent fixed values or configurations.

#### Example:

```javascript
// Good use of const
const totalStudents = 100;
const pi = 3.14;

// Avoid using const for changing values
let counter = 0;
// ... some code
counter += 1; // Use let for values that can change
```

Remember, `const` provides immutability to values, making your code more robust and easier to reason about when certain values should not be altered.
