Bitwise operations in JavaScript involve manipulating the individual bits of integers. These operations are performed on the binary representation of numbers, changing the state of individual bits to achieve specific results. There are several bitwise operators in JavaScript:

1. **AND Operator (`&`):**
   - The AND operator (`&`) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the resulting bit is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const result = 5 & 3; // Binary: 101 & 011 => 001 (Decimal: 1)
     ```

2. **OR Operator (`|`):**
   - The OR operator (`|`) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If at least one bit is 1, the resulting bit is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const result = 5 | 3; // Binary: 101 | 011 => 111 (Decimal: 7)
     ```

3. **XOR Operator (`^`):**
   - The XOR operator (`^`) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If the bits are different, the resulting bit is set to 1; if the bits are the same, the resulting bit is set to 0.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const result = 5 ^ 3; // Binary: 101 ^ 011 => 110 (Decimal: 6)
     ```

4. **NOT Operator (`~`):**
   - The NOT operator (`~`) inverts the bits of its operand. It changes each 0 to 1 and each 1 to 0.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const result = ~5; // Binary: ~101 => 11111111111111111111111111111010 (32-bit representation)
     ```

5. **Left Shift Operator (`<<`):**
   - The left shift operator (`<<`) shifts the bits of the first operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the second operand. The empty positions on the right are filled with zeros.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const result = 5 << 1; // Binary: 101 << 1 => 1010 (Decimal: 10)
     ```

6. **Right Shift Operator (`>>`):**
   - The right shift operator (`>>`) shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the second operand. The empty positions on the left are filled with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers, 1 for negative numbers).
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const result = 5 >> 1; // Binary: 101 >> 1 => 10 (Decimal: 2)
     ```

7. **Zero-fill Right Shift Operator (`>>>`):**
   - The zero-fill right shift operator (`>>>`) shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the second operand. The empty positions on the left are filled with zeros.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     const result = -5 >>> 1; // Binary: (32-bit) 11111111111111111111111111111011 >>> 1 => 01111111111111111111111111111101 (Decimal: 2147483645)
     ```

Bitwise operations are often used in low-level programming, optimization, and certain algorithms where individual bit manipulation is required. However, they may not be as common in everyday JavaScript programming.
