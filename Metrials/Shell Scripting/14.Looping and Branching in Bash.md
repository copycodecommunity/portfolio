Looping and branching are essential concepts in Bash scripting that allow you to execute commands multiple times (looping) or make decisions based on conditions (branching). Here’s a simple explanation of both concepts, along with examples.

### Looping in Bash

Looping allows you to repeat a set of commands multiple times. There are several types of loops in Bash, but the most common ones are `for`, `while`, and `until`.

#### 1. `for` Loop

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a list of items.

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop through a list of numbers
for number in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    echo "Number: $number"
done
```

**Explanation:**
- `for number in 1 2 3 4 5; do`: This line starts a loop that goes through each number in the list.
- `echo "Number: $number"`: This command prints the current number.
- `done`: This marks the end of the loop.

**Output:**
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

#### 2. `while` Loop

A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

count=1

# Loop while count is less than or equal to 5
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))  # Increment count by 1
done
```

**Explanation:**
- `count=1`: Initializes the variable `count` to 1.
- `while [ $count -le 5 ]; do`: This line starts the loop, which continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to 5.
- `echo "Count: $count"`: Prints the current count.
- `((count++))`: Increments the count by 1.
- `done`: Marks the end of the loop.

**Output:**
```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

### Branching in Bash

Branching allows you to execute different commands based on conditions. The most common branching statement is the `if` statement, which we discussed earlier. Here’s a quick recap and an additional example using `case`.

#### 1. `if` Statement

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number (1-3):"
read number

if [ $number -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "You entered one."
elif [ $number -eq 2 ]; then
    echo "You entered two."
elif [ $number -eq 3 ]; then
    echo "You entered three."
else
    echo "Invalid number."
fi
```

**Explanation:**
- Prompts the user to enter a number and checks if it is 1, 2, or 3, printing a corresponding message.

#### 2. `case` Statement

The `case` statement is another way to handle branching, especially when you have multiple conditions to check.

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a fruit (apple, banana, cherry):"
read fruit

case $fruit in
    apple)
        echo "You chose an apple."
        ;;
    banana)
        echo "You chose a banana."
        ;;
    cherry)
        echo "You chose a cherry."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown fruit."
        ;;
esac
```

**Explanation:**
- `case $fruit in`: Starts the case statement, checking the value of `fruit`.
- Each option (e.g., `apple`, `banana`, `cherry`) has its own block of code that executes if the condition matches.
- `*)`: This is a wildcard that matches anything not previously matched, acting as a default case.
- `esac`: Marks the end of the case statement.

### Summary

- **Looping**: Allows you to repeat commands using `for`, `while`, or `until` loops.
- **Branching**: Allows you to make decisions using `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `case` statements.
- **Combining Both**: You can use loops and branching together to create more complex scripts that can handle various scenarios and repeat tasks as needed.

These concepts are fundamental in Bash scripting and enable you to create powerful and flexible scripts.
