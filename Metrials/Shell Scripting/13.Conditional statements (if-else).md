Conditional statements in shell scripting allow you to execute different commands based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statement is the `if` statement. Here’s a simple explanation of how it works, along with examples.

### Basic Structure of an `if` Statement

The basic structure of an `if` statement in shell scripting is as follows:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition is true
else
    # commands to execute if condition is false
fi
```

### Example 1: Checking if a Number is Positive

Let’s create a simple script that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number:"
read number

if [ $number -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "The number is positive."
elif [ $number -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "The number is negative."
else
    echo "The number is zero."
fi
```

**Explanation:**
1. `#!/bin/bash`: This line indicates that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
2. `echo "Enter a number:"`: This line prompts the user to enter a number.
3. `read number`: This line reads the input from the user and stores it in the variable `number`.
4. `if [ $number -gt 0 ]; then`: This checks if the number is greater than 0 (positive).
5. `elif [ $number -lt 0 ]; then`: This checks if the number is less than 0 (negative).
6. `else`: This part executes if neither of the above conditions is true (the number is zero).
7. `fi`: This marks the end of the `if` statement.

### Example 2: Checking File Existence

Let’s create another script that checks if a file exists.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the filename:"
read filename

if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    echo "The file '$filename' exists."
else
    echo "The file '$filename' does not exist."
fi
```

**Explanation:**
1. `echo "Enter the filename:"`: This prompts the user to enter a filename.
2. `read filename`: This reads the input and stores it in the variable `filename`.
3. `if [ -e "$filename" ]; then`: This checks if the file exists. The `-e` flag is used to test for the existence of a file.
4. If the file exists, it prints a message saying the file exists; otherwise, it prints that the file does not exist.
5. `fi`: This marks the end of the `if` statement.

### Summary

- **`if` Statement**: Used to execute commands based on a condition.
- **`elif` Statement**: Used for additional conditions if the first `if` condition is false.
- **`else` Statement**: Used to execute commands if none of the previous conditions are true.
- **Conditions**: You can check various conditions, such as numerical comparisons (`-gt`, `-lt`, etc.) or file existence (`-e`).

These conditional statements are fundamental in shell scripting and allow you to create scripts that can make decisions based on user input or other conditions.
