In C, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can store. Here are some common data types in C along with explanations:

1. **Integers:**
   - **`int`:** Represents integer numbers (whole numbers without decimal points).
     ```c
     int age = 25;
     ```

   - **`short`:** Similar to `int`, but usually takes less memory.
     ```c
     short distance = 1000;
     ```

   - **`long`:** Similar to `int`, but can represent a larger range of values.
     ```c
     long population = 7000000000;
     ```

   - **`long long`:** Extended version of `long` for even larger values.
     ```c
     long long distance_to_star = 150000000000;
     ```

2. **Floating-point Numbers:**
   - **`float`:** Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points).
     ```c
     float temperature = 98.6;
     ```

   - **`double`:** Similar to `float`, but with higher precision and usually takes more memory.
     ```c
     double pi = 3.14159265359;
     ```

3. **Characters:**
   - **`char`:** Represents a single character.
     ```c
     char grade = 'A';
     ```

4. **Pointers:**
   - **`int*`:** Pointer to an integer.
     ```c
     int number = 42;
     int* ptr = &number;  // Pointer to the address of 'number'
     ```

   - **`char*`:** Pointer to a character.
     ```c
     char letter = 'X';
     char* charPtr = &letter;  // Pointer to the address of 'letter'
     ```

5. **Arrays:**
   - **`int[]`:** Array of integers.
     ```c
     int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
     ```

   - **`char[]`:** Array of characters (string).
     ```c
     char greeting[] = "Hello";
     ```

6. **Boolean:**
   - **`_Bool` or `bool`:** Represents boolean values (`true` or `false`).
     ```c
     _Bool isRaining = 1;  // true
     bool hasSunshine = false;  // false
     ```

7. **Enumerations:**
   - **`enum`:** Represents a set of named integer constants.
     ```c
     enum Days {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday};
     enum Days today = Wednesday;
     ```

8. **Structures:**
   - **`struct`:** Allows grouping of variables of different data types under a single name.
     ```c
     struct Person {
       char name[50];
       int age;
     };

     struct Person student;
     ```

9. **Void:**
   - **`void`:** Represents the absence of a type or an incomplete type.
     ```c
     void function() {
       // Function with no return type
     }
     ```

These are some of the fundamental data types in C. Understanding data types is crucial for correctly declaring and manipulating variables in your C programs.
