In C programming, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Here are some common operators in C along with explanations:

1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
   - **`+` (Addition):** Adds two operands.
   - **`-` (Subtraction):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
   - **`*` (Multiplication):** Multiplies two operands.
   - **`/` (Division):** Divides the left operand by the right operand.
   - **`%` (Modulus):** Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.

   ```c
   int a = 10, b = 3;
   int sum = a + b;      // 13
   int difference = a - b; // 7
   int product = a * b;   // 30
   int quotient = a / b;  // 3
   int remainder = a % b; // 1
   ```

2. **Relational Operators:**
   - **`==` (Equal to):** Checks if two operands are equal.
   - **`!=` (Not equal to):** Checks if two operands are not equal.
   - **`>` (Greater than):** Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
   - **`<` (Less than):** Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
   - **`>=` (Greater than or equal to):** Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
   - **`<=` (Less than or equal to):** Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

   ```c
   int x = 5, y = 10;
   int isEqual = (x == y);    // 0 (false)
   int notEqual = (x != y);    // 1 (true)
   int greaterThan = (x > y);  // 0 (false)
   int lessThan = (x < y);     // 1 (true)
   int greaterOrEqual = (x >= y); // 0 (false)
   int lessOrEqual = (x <= y);    // 1 (true)
   ```

3. **Logical Operators:**
   - **`&&` (Logical AND):** Returns true if both operands are true.
   - **`||` (Logical OR):** Returns true if at least one operand is true.
   - **`!` (Logical NOT):** Returns true if the operand is false, and vice versa.

   ```c
   int condition1 = 1, condition2 = 0;
   int resultAnd = (condition1 && condition2); // 0 (false)
   int resultOr = (condition1 || condition2);  // 1 (true)
   int resultNot = !condition1;                // 0 (false)
   ```

4. **Assignment Operators:**
   - **`=` (Assignment):** Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
   - **`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` (Compound Assignment):** Performs the operation and assigns the result to the left operand.

   ```c
   int num = 10;
   num += 5; // equivalent to num = num + 5; // 15
   ```

5. **Increment and Decrement Operators:**
   - **`++` (Increment):** Increases the value of the variable by 1.
   - **`--` (Decrement):** Decreases the value of the variable by 1.

   ```c
   int counter = 5;
   counter++; // equivalent to counter = counter + 1; // 6
   counter--; // equivalent to counter = counter - 1; // 5
   ```

6. **Bitwise Operators:**
   - **`&` (Bitwise AND):** Performs a bitwise AND operation.
   - **`|` (Bitwise OR):** Performs a bitwise OR operation.
   - **`^` (Bitwise XOR):** Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation.
   - **`~` (Bitwise NOT):** Flips the bits of the operand.

   ```c
   int a = 5, b = 3;
   int bitwiseAnd = a & b; // 1
   int bitwiseOr = a | b;  // 7
   int bitwiseXor = a ^ b; // 6
   int bitwiseNot = ~a;    // -6 (assuming 32-bit integer)
   ```

These are fundamental operators in C, and understanding how they work is essential for writing effective and correct programs.
