In C, a structure is a user-defined data type that allows you to group together variables of different data types under a single name. Here's an example of a structure in C along with an explanation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a structure named 'Person'
struct Person {
    // Members or fields of the structure
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};

int main() {
    // Declare a variable of type 'struct Person'
    struct Person person1;

    // Accessing and assigning values to the structure members
    printf("Enter name: ");
    scanf("%s", person1.name);  // 'name' is an array, so no '&' is needed
    printf("Enter age: ");
    scanf("%d", &person1.age);
    printf("Enter height: ");
    scanf("%f", &person1.height);

    // Displaying information using the structure
    printf("\nDetails entered:\n");
    printf("Name: %s\n", person1.name);
    printf("Age: %d\n", person1.age);
    printf("Height: %.2f\n", person1.height);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`:**
   - This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like `printf` and `scanf`.

2. **Defining a Structure:**
   - The `struct` keyword is used to define a structure. In this example, a structure named `Person` is defined.
   - Inside the structure, we have members or fields (`name`, `age`, `height`), each with its own data type.

3. **Declaring a Structure Variable:**
   - After defining the structure, you can declare variables of that type. In this example, `struct Person person1;` declares a variable named `person1` of type `struct Person`.

4. **Accessing Structure Members:**
   - To access members of a structure, you use the dot (`.`) operator. For example, `person1.name` refers to the `name` member of the `person1` structure.

5. **Taking Input:**
   - The program uses `scanf` to take input for the `name`, `age`, and `height` members of the structure.

6. **Displaying Information:**
   - Finally, the program uses `printf` to display the information entered by the user using the structure.

Structures provide a way to group related data together, making it easier to organize and manage complex data in a C program.
