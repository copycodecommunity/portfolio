In C, the boolean data type is not directly available like in some other programming languages. However, boolean values are often represented using integer values, where `0` typically represents `false`, and any non-zero value (usually `1`) represents `true`. 

Here's an example illustrating the representation of boolean values in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Using integers to represent boolean values
    int trueValue = 1;  // Represents true
    int falseValue = 0; // Represents false

    // Using conditions with boolean values
    if (trueValue) {
        printf("This statement is executed because trueValue is true.\n");
    } else {
        printf("This statement is not executed.\n");
    }

    if (!falseValue) {
        printf("This statement is executed because !falseValue is true.\n");
    } else {
        printf("This statement is not executed.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Integer Representation:**
   - In this example, `trueValue` is assigned the value `1`, and `falseValue` is assigned the value `0`.
   - Conventionally, `0` is considered `false`, and any non-zero value (usually `1`) is considered `true`.

2. **Conditionals with Boolean Values:**
   - In C, conditions in `if` statements evaluate to true if the expression is non-zero and false if it is zero.
   - `if (trueValue)` evaluates to true because `trueValue` is non-zero.
   - `if (!falseValue)` evaluates to true because `!falseValue` is equivalent to `!0`, which is true.

It's important to note that C doesn't have a dedicated boolean type (`bool`) as in some other languages. The use of `int` to represent boolean values is a common convention in C programming. Additionally, the header `<stdbool.h>` introduced with the C99 standard provides a boolean type and `true`/`false` constants, but it might not be universally supported in older compilers.
