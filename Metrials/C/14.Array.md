In C, an array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Here's an explanation of arrays in C:

### Declaration and Initialization:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declaration and Initialization of an integer array
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Declaration and Initialization of a character array (string)
    char name[6] = {'J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '\0'}; // '\0' indicates the end of the string

    // Accessing and modifying array elements
    numbers[2] = 10; // Modifying the value at index 2

    // Displaying array elements
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]); // Output: 1 2 10 4 5
    }

    printf("\nName: %s\n", name); // Output: Name: John

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Declaration and Initialization:**
   - Arrays are declared by specifying the data type of the elements, followed by the array name and the size in square brackets (`[]`).
   - Initialization involves providing values enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

2. **Accessing Array Elements:**
   - Array elements are accessed using their indices. In C, array indices start from 0.
   - For example, `numbers[2]` refers to the element at index 2 in the `numbers` array.

3. **Modifying Array Elements:**
   - Elements of an array can be modified by assigning a new value to the specific index.

4. **Looping Through Arrays:**
   - A loop, such as a `for` loop, can be used to iterate through array elements.
   - The loop variable (`i` in this case) is used as an index to access each element.

5. **Character Arrays (Strings):**
   - Strings in C are represented as character arrays. They are terminated with a null character `'\0'`, indicating the end of the string.
   - The `%s` format specifier is used to display strings with `printf`.

6. **Array Size:**
   - The size of an array is fixed at the time of declaration. In this example, the `numbers` array has a size of 5, and the `name` array has a size of 6.

Arrays in C provide a way to store and manipulate multiple values of the same type efficiently. Understanding array indexing and the use of loops is crucial when working with arrays in C.
