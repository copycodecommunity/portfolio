In C, the `switch` statement is a control flow statement that allows a program to evaluate an expression against multiple possible constant values. Here's an explanation of how the `switch` statement works:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int choice;

    // Prompt user for choice
    printf("Enter a number (1-3): ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);

    // Switch statement
    switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            printf("You chose Option 1\n");
            break; // Exit the switch block

        case 2:
            printf("You chose Option 2\n");
            break;

        case 3:
            printf("You chose Option 3\n");
            break;

        default:
            printf("Invalid choice\n");
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`:**
   - This line includes the standard input/output library to use functions like `printf` and `scanf`.

2. **Declaration of Variable:**
   - The variable `choice` is declared to store the user's input.

3. **User Input:**
   - The program prompts the user to enter a number, and the input is stored in the variable `choice` using `scanf`.

4. **`switch` Statement:**
   - The `switch` statement evaluates the value of the `choice` variable against different constant values (case labels).
   - If `choice` matches a case label, the corresponding block of code is executed.
   - The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` block and avoid falling through to the next case.

5. **`case` Labels:**
   - Each `case` label represents a possible value of the expression (`choice` in this case).
   - If the value of `choice` matches a `case` label, the corresponding block of code is executed.

6. **`default` Case:**
   - The `default` case is optional and is executed when none of the `case` labels match the value of the expression.
   - It serves as a catch-all for unexpected values.

7. **Execution Flow:**
   - The program starts evaluating from the `switch` expression (`choice`).
   - If a matching `case` is found, the corresponding block of code is executed, and the `switch` statement is exited.
   - If no match is found and there is a `default` case, its block is executed.

The `switch` statement provides an efficient way to handle multiple cases for a given value. It is particularly useful when you have a series of conditions to check against a single variable.
