In C, user input is typically obtained using the `scanf` function, which is part of the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`). Here's how you can take user input in C along with an explanation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare variables to store user input
    int num;
    float floatValue;
    char character;

    // Taking input for integer
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    // Taking input for floating-point number
    printf("Enter a float value: ");
    scanf("%f", &floatValue);

    // Taking input for character
    printf("Enter a character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &character);  // Note the space before %c to consume the newline character

    // Displaying the input values
    printf("You entered:\n");
    printf("Integer: %d\n", num);
    printf("Float: %f\n", floatValue);
    printf("Character: %c\n", character);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`:**
   - This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like `printf` and `scanf`.

2. **Declaration of Variables:**
   - Variables (`num`, `floatValue`, `character`) are declared to store the user input.

3. **`printf`:**
   - The `printf` function is used to display messages to the user, prompting them to enter specific types of values.

4. **`scanf`:**
   - The `scanf` function is used to take input from the user. It uses format specifiers (`%d`, `%f`, `%c`) to specify the type of input expected.
   - The ampersand (`&`) is used before the variable name to pass the memory address where the input should be stored.

5. **Note on Consuming Newline:**
   - When using `%c` to read a character, a newline character from a previous input (e.g., pressing Enter after entering a number) might be in the input buffer. Adding a space before `%c` in `scanf` helps consume the newline
