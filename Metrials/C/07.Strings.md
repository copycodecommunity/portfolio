In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters, terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). The standard library provides functions for manipulating strings, and here's an overview along with explanations:

1. **String Declaration:**
   - Strings in C are declared as character arrays with a null character at the end.

   ```c
   char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
   // or
   char greeting[] = "Hello";
   ```

2. **String Input:**
   - The `gets` function is used to input a string.

   ```c
   char name[50];
   printf("Enter your name: ");
   gets(name);
   ```

   **Note:** The use of `gets` is discouraged due to the risk of buffer overflow. Instead, consider using `fgets` or other safer alternatives.

3. **String Output:**
   - The `puts` function is used to output a string.

   ```c
   char greeting[] = "Hello";
   puts(greeting);
   ```

4. **String Length:**
   - The `strlen` function calculates the length of a string.

   ```c
   char message[] = "Hello, World!";
   int length = strlen(message); // 13
   ```

5. **String Concatenation:**
   - The `strcat` function concatenates two strings.

   ```c
   char str1[20] = "Hello";
   char str2[] = ", World!";
   strcat(str1, str2); // str1 now contains "Hello, World!"
   ```

6. **String Copy:**
   - The `strcpy` function copies one string to another.

   ```c
   char source[] = "Copy me!";
   char destination[20];
   strcpy(destination, source); // destination now contains "Copy me!"
   ```

7. **String Comparison:**
   - The `strcmp` function compares two strings.

   ```c
   char str1[] = "apple";
   char str2[] = "banana";
   int result = strcmp(str1, str2);
   // result is negative if str1 is lexicographically before str2
   // result is positive if str1 is lexicographically after str2
   // result is zero if str1 and str2 are equal
   ```

8. **String Searching:**
   - The `strstr` function searches for a substring within a string.

   ```c
   char sentence[] = "C programming is fun!";
   char keyword[] = "programming";
   char *result = strstr(sentence, keyword);
   // result points to the start of "programming" within the sentence
   ```

9. **String Tokenization:**
   - The `strtok` function is used for tokenizing a string.

   ```c
   char sentence[] = "C programming is fun!";
   char *token = strtok(sentence, " "); // tokenizes based on space
   while (token != NULL) {
       printf("%s\n", token);
       token = strtok(NULL, " ");
   }
   ```

These are some fundamental concepts related to strings in C. String manipulation in C requires careful handling of memory and understanding the null-terminated nature of strings. It's crucial to use functions that ensure buffer safety to avoid common programming errors.
