In C, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. Here are the main types of loops in C, along with explanations:

### 1. **`for` Loop:**
   - The `for` loop is used when you know how many times you want to execute a block of code.
   - Syntax:
     ```c
     for (initialization; condition; update) {
         // code to be executed
     }
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - **Initialization:** Executed only once at the beginning of the loop.
     - **Condition:** Checked before each iteration. If true, the loop continues; otherwise, it exits.
     - **Update:** Executed after each iteration.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
           printf("%d ", i);
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

### 2. **`while` Loop:**
   - The `while` loop is used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop will be executed.
   - Syntax:
     ```c
     while (condition) {
         // code to be executed
     }
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - **Condition:** Checked before each iteration. If true, the loop continues; otherwise, it exits.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       int i = 1;
       while (i <= 5) {
           printf("%d ", i);
           i++;
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

### 3. **`do-while` Loop:**
   - Similar to the `while` loop, but the code is executed at least once because the condition is checked after the loop body.
   - Syntax:
     ```c
     do {
         // code to be executed
     } while (condition);
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - **Code Execution:** Occurs at least once.
     - **Condition:** Checked after each iteration. If true, the loop continues; otherwise, it exits.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       int i = 1;
       do {
           printf("%d ", i);
           i++;
       } while (i <= 5);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

### 4. **`break` and `continue`:**
   - The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.
   - The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the loop's code and move to the next iteration.

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
           if (i == 3) {
               break;  // exit the loop when i is 3
           }
           printf("%d ", i);
       }

       printf("\n");

       for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
           if (i == 3) {
               continue;  // skip the rest of the loop when i is 3
           }
           printf("%d ", i);
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

These loops provide the necessary constructs for repetitive execution of code in C. Choose the loop type based on your specific requirements.
