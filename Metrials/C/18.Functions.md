In C, a function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or a set of related tasks. Functions provide modularity, allowing you to break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces. Here's an example of a simple C function along with an explanation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration (prototype)
int addNumbers(int a, int b);

int main() {
    // Variables to store user input
    int num1, num2;

    // Get user input
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);

    // Call the addNumbers function and store the result
    int result = addNumbers(num1, num2);

    // Display the result
    printf("Sum: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    // Function body
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;  // Return the result to the caller
}
```

Explanation:

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`:**
   - This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like `printf` and `scanf`.

2. **Function Declaration (Prototype):**
   - Before the `main` function, there is a function declaration or prototype: `int addNumbers(int a, int b);`
   - This informs the compiler that there exists a function named `addNumbers` that takes two `int` parameters and returns an `int`.

3. **`main` Function:**
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It's the first function that gets executed when the program runs.
   - It declares two variables (`num1` and `num2`) to store user input.
   - It uses `printf` and `scanf` to get two integer values from the user.
   - It calls the `addNumbers` function, passing the user-input values as arguments, and stores the result in the `result` variable.
   - Finally, it displays the result using `printf`.

4. **Function Definition:**
   - Below the `main` function is the definition of the `addNumbers` function.
   - It specifies the return type (`int`) and parameter types (`int a, int b`).
   - The function body contains the code that performs the addition of the two parameters (`a` and `b`).
   - The `return` statement is used to send the result back to the caller (in this case, the `main` function).

5. **Return Statement:**
   - The `return` statement is used to send a value back to the caller of the function. In this example, the sum of `a` and `b` is returned.

6. **Function Call:**
   - In the `main` function, `addNumbers(num1, num2);` is called with the values entered by the user. The result is then stored in the `result` variable.

Functions in C can be more complex, with multiple parameters, local variables, and more intricate logic. They play a crucial role in organizing and structuring C programs.
