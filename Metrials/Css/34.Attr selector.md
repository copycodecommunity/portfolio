In CSS, an attribute selector is used to select elements based on the presence or value of attributes. There are different types of attribute selectors in CSS, allowing you to target elements based on specific conditions. Here are some common attribute selectors with explanations:

1. **Existence Attribute Selector:**
   - Selects elements that have a specific attribute, regardless of its value.
   ```css
   [attribute] {
     /* Styles applied to elements with 'attribute' */
   }
   ```
   Example:
   ```css
   [target] {
     color: blue;
   }
   ```
   This selects all elements with the `target` attribute, regardless of its value.

2. **Equality Attribute Selector:**
   - Selects elements with a specific attribute and value.
   ```css
   [attribute=value] {
     /* Styles applied to elements with 'attribute' equal to 'value' */
   }
   ```
   Example:
   ```css
   [type="checkbox"] {
     border: 2px solid green;
   }
   ```
   This selects all checkbox elements.

3. **Prefix Match Attribute Selector:**
   - Selects elements where the attribute value starts with a specified string.
   ```css
   [attribute^="value"] {
     /* Styles applied to elements with 'attribute' starting with 'value' */
   }
   ```
   Example:
   ```css
   [href^="https://"] {
     color: red;
   }
   ```
   This selects all links with `href` starting with "https://".

4. **Substring Match Attribute Selector:**
   - Selects elements where the attribute value contains a specified substring.
   ```css
   [attribute*="value"] {
     /* Styles applied to elements with 'attribute' containing 'value' */
   }
   ```
   Example:
   ```css
   [title*="CSS"] {
     font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```
   This selects elements with a `title` attribute containing "CSS".

5. **Suffix Match Attribute Selector:**
   - Selects elements where the attribute value ends with a specified string.
   ```css
   [attribute$="value"] {
     /* Styles applied to elements with 'attribute' ending with 'value' */
   }
   ```
   Example:
   ```css
   [src$=".png"] {
     border: 1px solid black;
   }
   ```
   This selects elements with `src` ending in ".png".

These attribute selectors provide a flexible way to target and style elements based on their attributes, giving you more control over your styles and layout.
