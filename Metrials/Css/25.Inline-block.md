The `inline-block` value in CSS is used to make an element generate a block-level box that's placed inline with the content around it. It combines features of both inline and block-level elements. Here's an explanation of `inline-block` with an example:

```css
/* CSS styles */
.inline-block-container {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    margin: 10px;
}

/* HTML structure */
<div class="inline-block-container">
    This is an inline-block element.
</div>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`display: inline-block;`**:
   - This property is applied to the container element with the class `.inline-block-container`. It sets the display value to `inline-block`, making the element generate a block-level box and be placed inline with the content around it.

2. **`width` and `height`**:
   - Setting a width and height gives the inline-block element specific dimensions. In the example, the element has a width of `200px` and a height of `100px`.

3. **`background-color`**:
   - This property sets the background color of the inline-block element. In this case, it's set to `lightblue`.

4. **`margin`**:
   - Margin is added around the inline-block element to create space between this element and other elements on the page. The margin is set to `10px`.

5. **HTML Structure**:
   - The `<div>` element with the class `.inline-block-container` is an example of an inline-block element.

**Key Characteristics of `inline-block`:**
- **Inline Flow:** The element flows with the content horizontally, allowing other elements to be next to it on the same line.
- **Block-Level Features:** It retains block-level features such as setting width, height, margin, and padding.
- **No Line Breaks:** There is no line break after the element. If there's space in the line, other elements can be placed alongside it.

**Use Cases:**
- Creating horizontal navigation menus.
- Creating grids or columns of content.
- Combining text and images in a line.

Keep in mind that `inline-block` has some nuances, such as the presence of whitespace between inline-block elements affecting the layout. Techniques like setting the font size to 0 on the container and resetting it on the child elements are often used to overcome this issue.
