In CSS, pseudo-elements are used to style specific parts of an element. They are denoted by two colons (::) followed by the name of the pseudo-element. Pseudo-elements allow you to style parts of an element that are not part of the document tree, such as the first line or the first letter of an element. Here are some commonly used pseudo-elements in CSS with explanations:

1. **::before:**
   - Creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element.
   - Used to insert content before the content of the selected element.

   ```css
   p::before {
       content: "Before text: ";
       font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```

2. **::after:**
   - Creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element.
   - Used to insert content after the content of the selected element.

   ```css
   p::after {
       content: " (After text)";
       font-style: italic;
   }
   ```

3. **::first-line:**
   - Selects the first line of the text content of an element.
   - Used to style the appearance of the first line.

   ```css
   p::first-line {
       font-weight: bold;
       color: blue;
   }
   ```

4. **::first-letter:**
   - Selects the first letter of the text content of an element.
   - Used to style the appearance of the first letter.

   ```css
   p::first-letter {
       font-size: larger;
       color: red;
   }
   ```

5. **::selection:**
   - Represents a portion of an element that is selected by a user.
   - Used to style the selected text.

   ```css
   ::selection {
       background-color: yellow;
       color: black;
   }
   ```

6. **::placeholder:**
   - Selects the placeholder text in an input field.
   - Used to style the appearance of the placeholder text.

   ```css
   input::placeholder {
       color: gray;
   }
   ```

These are just a few examples of pseudo-elements in CSS. Pseudo-elements provide a way to style specific parts of an element without the need for additional HTML markup. They are a powerful tool for enhancing the visual presentation of web pages.
