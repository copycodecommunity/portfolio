In CSS, the `z-index` property is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements along the z-axis (depth) on a web page. It determines which elements should appear on top of others when they overlap in the layout. The `z-index` property accepts integer values, and elements with higher `z-index` values will appear on top of elements with lower values.

Here's an explanation of how `z-index` works:

1. **Default Stacking Order:**
   - By default, elements are stacked in the order they appear in the HTML document. Elements defined later in the document appear on top of elements defined earlier.

2. **Stacking Context:**
   - The `z-index` property only works on positioned elements (i.e., elements with a `position` value of `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`). Non-positioned elements have a stacking order based on their order in the document.

3. **Integer Values:**
   - The `z-index` property accepts integer values, both positive and negative. Positive values bring an element forward in the stacking order, and negative values push it backward.

   ```css
   .element {
       z-index: 2;   /* Positive value, brings the element forward */
   }

   .another-element {
       z-index: -1;  /* Negative value, pushes the element backward */
   }
   ```

4. **Higher Value, Closer to the Top:**
   - Elements with higher `z-index` values will appear on top of elements with lower values, creating a stacking hierarchy.

   ```css
   .top-element {
       z-index: 3;
   }

   .bottom-element {
       z-index: 1;
   }
   ```

5. **Stacking Within a Container:**
   - The `z-index` property is relative to the stacking context. If elements are within a container with a different `z-index` value, the stacking order will be determined within that container.

   ```css
   .parent-container {
       z-index: 10;
   }

   .child-element {
       z-index: 5;   /* Stacking order is relative to the parent container */
   }
   ```

6. **Auto Stacking Order:**
   - If no `z-index` is specified, the default stacking order is applied based on the order in the document.

   ```css
   .first-element {
       /* No z-index specified, follows default stacking order */
   }

   .second-element {
       /* No z-index specified, follows default stacking order */
   }
   ```

7. **Stacking Order and Position Property:**
   - The `position` property (with a value other than `static`) creates a stacking context. Elements with a stacking context are always rendered above non-stacking context elements.

   ```css
   .stacking-context-element {
       position: relative; /* or absolute, fixed, sticky */
       z-index: 100;
   }

   .non-stacking-context-element {
       /* No position specified, follows default stacking order */
   }
   ```

Understanding the `z-index` property is crucial when dealing with layered layouts, especially in scenarios where elements overlap or are positioned relative to each other. It allows you to control the visual hierarchy of elements on a web page.
