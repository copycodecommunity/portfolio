In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), specificity is a set of rules used to determine which style declarations will take precedence when multiple rules target the same element. It is crucial for understanding how styles are applied and overridden in a stylesheet. Specificity is usually represented as a four-part value, such as `0,0,0,0`, where each part corresponds to a different level of specificity. Let's break down the specificity components:

1. **Inline Styles:**
   - The highest specificity is given to inline styles applied directly to an element using the `style` attribute. The specificity value for inline styles is `1,0,0,0`.

   ```html
   <div style="color: red;">This text is red.</div>
   ```

2. **ID Selectors:**
   - ID selectors are more specific than class selectors. The specificity value for an ID selector is `0,1,0,0`.

   ```css
   #myElement {
       color: blue;
   }
   ```

3. **Class, Attribute, and Pseudo-Class Selectors:**
   - These selectors have a specificity value of `0,0,1,0`. They are less specific than ID selectors.

   ```css
   .myClass {
       font-size: 16px;
   }

   [type="submit"] {
       background-color: green;
   }

   :hover {
       text-decoration: underline;
   }
   ```

4. **Element and Pseudo-Element Selectors:**
   - These selectors are the least specific and have a specificity value of `0,0,0,1`.

   ```css
   p {
       line-height: 1.5;
   }

   ::before {
       content: "*";
   }
   ```

5. **Combinators and Multiple Selectors:**
   - When selectors are combined or multiple selectors are used, their specificity values are combined. For example, `h2 + p` has a specificity value of `0,0,1,1` because it combines an element selector (`p`) and a combinator (`+`).

   ```css
   h2 + p {
       margin-top: 10px;
   }
   ```

**How Specificity Works:**
- When conflicting styles are applied to an element, the browser calculates the specificity of each rule and applies the style with the highest specificity.
- If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears later in the stylesheet takes precedence (it has a higher "source order").

**Example:**

```css
/* Rule 1 */
p {
    color: red;
}

/* Rule 2 */
#myParagraph {
    color: blue;
}

/* Rule 3 */
p#myParagraph {
    color: green;
}
```

In this example, if an element with the ID `myParagraph` is a paragraph (`<p>`), Rule 3 will take precedence over Rule 1 and Rule 2 because it has the highest specificity.
