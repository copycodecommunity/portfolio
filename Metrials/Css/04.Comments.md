In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), comments can be used to add explanatory notes or annotations within your stylesheets. Comments in CSS are not rendered in the browser and are solely for the developer's reference. Here's how you can add comments in CSS with explanations:

### Single-Line Comments:

```css
/* This is a single-line comment */
/* Single-line comments start with '/*' and end with '*/' */

body {
  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif; /* Set the font family for the body */
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Set the background color */
}

/* You can also use // for single-line comments in some cases, though it's not part of the official CSS specification. */

/* background-color: #f0f0f0; // This is a single-line comment using // */
```

### Multi-Line Comments:

```css
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  Multi-line comments start with '/*' and end with '*/'
*/

.header {
  color: #333; /* Set text color for the header */
  padding: 10px; /* Add padding to the header */
}

/*
  You can use multi-line comments for longer explanations or to temporarily exclude a block of code.
*/
```

### Explanation:

1. **Single-Line Comments (`/* ... */`):**
   - Single-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
   - Anything between these symbols is treated as a comment and is ignored by the browser.
   - Single-line comments are suitable for short explanations or annotations.

2. **Multi-Line Comments (`/* ... */`):**
   - Multi-line comments also start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
   - They are useful for longer explanations or for commenting out entire blocks of code temporarily.
   - Multi-line comments are particularly handy when you want to provide context for a set of styles.

3. **Use of Comments:**
   - Comments are valuable for documenting your CSS code, making it easier for you and others to understand the purpose of different styles.
   - They can be used to explain why certain styles are applied, provide context, or temporarily disable styles without deleting them.

Remember, good code documentation is essential for maintaining and collaborating on projects, and comments in your CSS play a key role in achieving that.
