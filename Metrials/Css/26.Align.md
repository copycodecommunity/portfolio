In CSS, the `text-align` property is used to specify the horizontal alignment of text within an element. Additionally, the `align-items` and `justify-content` properties are used to align and justify the content within a flex container. Here's an explanation of these properties:

1. **`text-align`:**
   - **Description:** This property is used to set the horizontal alignment of text content inside an element.
   - **Values:**
     - `left`: Aligns the text to the left.
     - `right`: Aligns the text to the right.
     - `center`: Centers the text.
     - `justify`: Justifies the text, i.e., adjusts the spacing between words to fill the entire line.
   - **Example:**
     ```css
     .container {
       text-align: center;
     }
     ```

2. **`align-items` (Flexbox):**
   - **Description:** This property is used in a flex container to define how the flex container's items are aligned along the cross-axis (vertical axis).
   - **Values:**
     - `flex-start`: Aligns items to the start of the container.
     - `flex-end`: Aligns items to the end of the container.
     - `center`: Centers items along the cross-axis.
     - `baseline`: Aligns items to the baseline of the container.
     - `stretch`: Default value. Items are stretched to fill the container.
   - **Example:**
     ```css
     .flex-container {
       display: flex;
       align-items: center;
     }
     ```

3. **`justify-content` (Flexbox):**
   - **Description:** This property is used in a flex container to define how the flex container's items are justified along the main-axis (horizontal axis).
   - **Values:**
     - `flex-start`: Justifies items to the start of the container.
     - `flex-end`: Justifies items to the end of the container.
     - `center`: Centers items along the main-axis.
     - `space-between`: Distributes items evenly, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
     - `space-around`: Distributes items evenly with equal space around them.
     - `space-evenly`: Distributes items evenly with equal space around and at the start and end.
   - **Example:**
     ```css
     .flex-container {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: space-between;
     }
     ```

These CSS properties provide control over the alignment of text and content within elements, allowing you to create visually appealing layouts. The usage depends on whether you are working with regular elements or flex containers.
