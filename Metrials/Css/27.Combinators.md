In CSS, combinators are used to define relationships between different HTML elements. They are used in CSS selectors to specify the styling for a specific set of elements based on their relationship to other elements. There are several types of combinators in CSS, each serving a different purpose. Here are the main combinators along with explanations:

1. **Descendant Combinator (Whitespace):**
   - The descendant combinator, represented by a whitespace, selects all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

   ```css
   div p {
     /* Styles applied to all <p> elements inside a <div> */
   }
   ```

2. **Child Combinator (>):**
   - The child combinator selects all direct children of a specified element.

   ```css
   div > p {
     /* Styles applied to all <p> elements that are direct children of a <div> */
   }
   ```

3. **Adjacent Sibling Combinator (+):**
   - The adjacent sibling combinator selects an element that is immediately preceded by a specified element.

   ```css
   h2 + p {
     /* Styles applied to all <p> elements that are immediately preceded by an <h2> */
   }
   ```

4. **General Sibling Combinator (~):**
   - The general sibling combinator selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.

   ```css
   h2 ~ p {
     /* Styles applied to all <p> elements that are siblings of an <h2> */
   }
   ```

5. **Attribute Selector ([]):**
   - The attribute selector selects elements with a specific attribute and, optionally, a specific attribute value.

   ```css
   input[type="text"] {
     /* Styles applied to all <input> elements with type="text" */
   }
   ```

6. **Grouping (,):**
   - The grouping selector groups several selectors together, applying the same styles to multiple selectors.

   ```css
   h1, h2, h3 {
     /* Styles applied to all <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> elements */
   }
   ```

These combinators provide a powerful way to target and style specific elements or groups of elements in your HTML document. By understanding how these combinators work, you can create more precise and efficient CSS styles for your web pages.
