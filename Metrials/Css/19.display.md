In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the `display` property is used to define the display behavior of an HTML element. It determines how the element generates boxes and how it interacts with other elements. Here are some common values for the `display` property along with explanations:

1. **`display: block;`**
   - Elements with `display: block;` generate a block-level container box.
   - Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available.

   ```css
   div {
       display: block;
   }
   ```

2. **`display: inline;`**
   - Elements with `display: inline;` generate an inline-level container box.
   - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

   ```css
   span {
       display: inline;
   }
   ```

3. **`display: inline-block;`**
   - Elements with `display: inline-block;` generate an inline-level container box but behave as block-level elements regarding layout.
   - They do not start on a new line, and they can have a width and height.

   ```css
   img {
       display: inline-block;
   }
   ```

4. **`display: none;`**
   - Elements with `display: none;` are not displayed at all.
   - They are not rendered on the page and do not take up any space.

   ```css
   .hidden {
       display: none;
   }
   ```

5. **`display: flex;`**
   - Elements with `display: flex;` become a flex container, and their children become flex items.
   - It enables a flex context for the container, allowing you to use flex properties for layout.

   ```css
   .flex-container {
       display: flex;
   }
   ```

6. **`display: grid;`**
   - Elements with `display: grid;` become a grid container, and their children become grid items.
   - It enables a grid context for the container, allowing you to use grid properties for layout.

   ```css
   .grid-container {
       display: grid;
   }
   ```

7. **`display: inline-flex;` and `display: inline-grid;`**
   - Similar to `display: flex;` and `display: grid;` but generate inline-level containers.
   - They enable flex or grid layout but do not start on a new line.

   ```css
   .inline-flex-container {
       display: inline-flex;
   }

   .inline-grid-container {
       display: inline-grid;
   }
   ```

These are some of the commonly used `display` property values in CSS. Choosing the appropriate value depends on the desired layout and behavior of the elements on your webpage.
