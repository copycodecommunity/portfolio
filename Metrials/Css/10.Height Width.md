In CSS, the `height` and `width` properties are used to set the dimensions of an element. Here's an explanation of how these properties work:

### `height` Property:

The `height` property is used to set the height of an element. It can take various values, such as:

- **Fixed Height:**
  ```css
  height: 100px; /* Sets the height to a fixed value of 100 pixels */
  ```

- **Percentage Height:**
  ```css
  height: 50%; /* Sets the height to 50% of its containing element's height */
  ```

- **Viewport Height:**
  ```css
  height: 50vh; /* Sets the height to 50% of the viewport height */
  ```

- **Auto Height:**
  ```css
  height: auto; /* Allows the element to adjust its height based on its content */
  ```

### `width` Property:

The `width` property is used to set the width of an element. Similar to `height`, it can take various values:

- **Fixed Width:**
  ```css
  width: 200px; /* Sets the width to a fixed value of 200 pixels */
  ```

- **Percentage Width:**
  ```css
  width: 75%; /* Sets the width to 75% of its containing element's width */
  ```

- **Viewport Width:**
  ```css
  width: 50vw; /* Sets the width to 50% of the viewport width */
  ```

- **Auto Width:**
  ```css
  width: auto; /* Allows the element to adjust its width based on its content */
  ```

### Example:

```css
.container {
  width: 80%;       /* 80% of containing element's width */
  height: 300px;    /* Fixed height of 300 pixels */
  max-width: 1000px; /* Maximum width allowed for the container */
  margin: 0 auto;   /* Center the container horizontally */
  padding: 20px;     /* Add padding around the content */
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in the total width and height */
}
```

In this example, the container element has a width of 80% of its containing element's width, a fixed height of 300 pixels, a maximum width of 1000 pixels, and some margin and padding. The `box-sizing` property ensures that padding and border are included in the total width and height of the container.

These properties are fundamental for controlling the layout and dimensions of elements on a webpage, allowing for responsiveness and design flexibility.
