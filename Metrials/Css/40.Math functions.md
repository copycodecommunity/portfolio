CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is primarily a styling language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. Unlike programming languages, CSS doesn't have built-in mathematical functions. However, you can achieve some mathematical operations and calculations in CSS using various properties and units. Here are some examples:

### 1. **Calc() Function:**
The `calc()` function allows you to perform calculations for property values. It supports basic arithmetic operations.

```css
width: calc(50% - 20px);
```

In this example, the width is set to 50% of the parent width minus 20 pixels.

### 2. **Viewport Units:**
Viewport units (`vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`) are relative to the viewport size. They can be used for responsive design.

```css
font-size: 3vw; /* 3% of the viewport width */
```

### 3. **Custom Properties (Variables):**
You can use custom properties (CSS variables) for more dynamic values.

```css
:root {
  --main-width: 300px;
}

.element {
  width: var(--main-width);
}
```

Changing the `--main-width` variable will affect all elements using it.

### 4. **Percentage and Relative Units:**
Percentage values are relative to the parent element, and relative units like `em` and `rem` are based on the font size.

```css
font-size: 1.2em; /* 1.2 times the parent's font size */
```

### 5. **Transform Property:**
The `transform` property allows you to apply transformations, including scaling, rotating, and translating.

```css
transform: scale(1.2);
```

This scales the element by a factor of 1.2.

### 6. **Mathematical Functions in Sass/SCSS:**
If you are using Sass or SCSS (CSS preprocessors), you have access to more advanced math functions.

```scss
$base-width: 100px;

.element {
  width: $base-width * 1.5;
}
```

### Note:
- While CSS itself doesn't have extensive mathematical capabilities, combining it with HTML and JavaScript can provide more dynamic and interactive calculations.

- Keep in mind that CSS is primarily for styling, and complex calculations or logic are often better handled by JavaScript.

Always consider browser compatibility and the specific requirements of your project when using these techniques.
