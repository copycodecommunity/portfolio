In CSS, an outline is a border that is drawn around the outside of an element, but it does not affect the element's layout. It is typically used to highlight or emphasize an element. Here's how you can use the `outline` property in CSS along with an explanation:

```css
/* CSS Styles */
.element {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: #3498db;
    margin: 20px;
    padding: 10px;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Apply Outline */
.element:hover {
    outline: 2px solid #e74c3c;
    /* width and color can be adjusted */
}

/* Additional Styling for Demonstration */
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
}

/* Additional Styling for Demonstration */
.container {
    display: flex;
}
```

Explanation:

1. **`.element`:**
   - This is a class selector for an element you want to apply an outline to.

2. **Element Properties:**
   - `width`, `height`, `background-color`, `margin`, `padding`, `color`, and `text-align` are applied for styling the element. These properties are for demonstration purposes and can be adjusted based on your specific requirements.

3. **`.element:hover`:**
   - This is a pseudo-class selector that targets the element when it is being hovered over by the user.

4. **`outline: 2px solid #e74c3c;`:**
   - The `outline` property is set to draw a solid red border (`#e74c3c`) with a width of `2px`. You can customize the width and color according to your design.

5. **Additional Styling:**
   - The additional styling for the body and container is just for demonstration purposes. The outline itself can be applied to any element based on your design requirements.

Usage:
- Apply the "element" class to the HTML element you want to have an outline.
- When the element is hovered over, the outline will be displayed.

Remember, the `outline` property does not affect the layout of the page, and it is separate from the `border` property. It is often used for highlighting interactive elements during user interaction.
