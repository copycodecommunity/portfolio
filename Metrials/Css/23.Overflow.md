In CSS, the `overflow` property is used to control what happens when an element's content is larger than the element's box. It specifies whether to clip content, render scrollbars, or automatically expand the size of the container. The `overflow` property can take the following values:

1. **visible:**
   - This is the default value. Content will overflow the box, potentially overlapping other elements.

   ```css
   .container {
       overflow: visible;
   }
   ```

2. **hidden:**
   - Content that overflows the box will be hidden, and the user won't be able to see or interact with it.

   ```css
   .container {
       overflow: hidden;
   }
   ```

3. **scroll:**
   - Scrollbars will be added to the box, allowing the user to scroll and see the hidden content.

   ```css
   .container {
       overflow: scroll;
   }
   ```

4. **auto:**
   - Scrollbars will be added only if the content overflows the box. If the content fits, no scrollbars will appear.

   ```css
   .container {
       overflow: auto;
   }
   ```

5. **overlay:**
   - Scrollbars are only added when necessary, and they don't affect the size of the box. This is similar to `auto`, but it provides a little more flexibility in certain situations.

   ```css
   .container {
       overflow: overlay;
   }
   ```

**Examples:**

1. **Visible Overflow:**
   ```css
   .container {
       width: 200px;
       height: 200px;
       overflow: visible;
   }
   ```

   In this case, if the content inside `.container` exceeds its dimensions, it will overflow and potentially overlap other elements.

2. **Hidden Overflow:**
   ```css
   .container {
       width: 200px;
       height: 200px;
       overflow: hidden;
   }
   ```

   If the content inside `.container` exceeds its dimensions, it will be hidden, and no scrollbars will be provided.

3. **Scroll Overflow:**
   ```css
   .container {
       width: 200px;
       height: 200px;
       overflow: scroll;
   }
   ```

   If the content inside `.container` exceeds its dimensions, scrollbars will be provided for the user to scroll and see the hidden content.

4. **Auto Overflow:**
   ```css
   .container {
       width: 200px;
       height: 200px;
       overflow: auto;
   }
   ```

   If the content inside `.container` exceeds its dimensions, scrollbars will be added. If the content fits, no scrollbars will appear.

The `overflow` property is particularly useful when dealing with containers and layouts to control how content is displayed when it exceeds the available space.
